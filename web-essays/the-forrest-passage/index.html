        <em>by Ernst Junger<br></em>
    </div>
    <div id=”placeholder”>What is the terrible question that the void poses to man? It is the ancient riddle of the
        Sphinx to Oedipus. Man is interrogated about himself—does he know the name of the curious being that moves
        through time? Depending on his answer, he will be devoured or crowned. The void wants to know if man is equal to
        it, whether there are elements in him that no time can destroy. In this sense, the void and time are identical;
        and so it is understandable that with the great power of the void time becomes very valuable, even in its
        tiniest fractions. At the same time, the apparatuses continue to multiply—that is, the arsenal of time. This
        results in the error that it is the apparatuses, in particular machine technology, that render the world void.
        The opposite is true: the apparatuses grow relentlessly and draw ever closer because an answer is again due to
        the age-old question to man. The apparatuses are witnesses that time needs to demonstrate to the senses its
        superiority. If man answers correctly, the apparatuses lose their magical gleam and submit themselves to his
        hand. It is important to realize this.

        We have touched here on the fundamental issue: time’s question to man about his power.

        <p>The forest passage—it is no jaunt that is concealed in this title.
            Rather, the reader should be prepared for a dangerous expedition,
            leading not merely beyond the blazed trails but also beyond the
            limits of his considerations.</p>


        <p>A core question of our times is concerned, that is, a question that
            will in any event involve personal danger. To be sure, we discuss
            questions a great deal, as our fathers and grandfathers before us did.
            But what is termed a question in this sense has naturally changed
            considerably since their days. Are we sufficiently aware of this yet?</p>


        <p>The times are scarcely over when such questions were understood
            as great enigmas, even as cosmic enigmas, and accompanied by an
            optimism that was confident of finding answers. Other questions
            were viewed rather as practical problems, women’s rights for
            instance, or the social question in general. These problems too were
            considered resolvable, albeit less through research than by an
            evolution of society toward new orders and arrangements.</p>


        <p>In the meantime the social question has been worked out in broad
            regions of our globe. The classless society has developed it into
            more of an element of foreign policy than anything else. Of course,
            this by no means implies that the issues themselves have thereby
            disappeared, as was believed in the first rapturous moments;
            instead, other even more burning questions have arisen. One such
            question will occupy us here.</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="2">2</section>

        <p>Our reader will have learned from personal experience that the
            nature of questions themselves has changed. Today we are
            unremittingly approached by questioning powers, and these powers
            are not motivated solely by the ideal of increasing knowledge. In
            coming to us with their questions, they are not expecting us to
            contribute to objective truth, nor even to solve specific problems.
            They are interested not in our solutions but in our answers.</p>


        <p>This is an important difference. It turns the questioning into
            something closer to an interrogation. This can be followed in the
            evolution from the electoral ballot to the questionnaire. An electoral
            ballot aims at purely numerical ratios and the evaluation thereof. It
            exists to fathom the will of the voters, and the voting procedure is
            designed to produce a pure representation of this will, unaffected by
            external influences. Voting is thus accompanied by the sense of
            security—and even power-that characterizes a freely expressed act
            of will within a legal sphere.</p>


        <p>The contemporary man who sees himself prevailed upon to fill out a
            questionnaire is far from any such security. The answers he provides
            will have far-reaching consequences; his very fate often depends on
            them. We see people getting into predicaments where they are
            required to produce documents aimed at their own ruin—and what
            trifles may not cause ruin today.</p>


        <p>It is apparent that this change in the nature of questioning presages
            a quite different order from what we had at the beginning of the
            century. The old sense of security is gone, and our thinking must be
            adjusted accordingly. The questions press in on us, more closely and
            insistently, and the way we answer becomes all the more
            significative. We also need to keep in mind that silence itself is an
            answer. They ask why we kept quiet at just that place and time, and
            present us the bill for our response. These are the quandaries of our
            times, which none can escape.</p>


        <p>It is remarkable how under such conditions everything becomes an
            answer in this special sense, and thereby a matter of our
            responsibility. Thus, perhaps even today, we do not clearly enough
            perceive to what degree the electoral ballot has been transformed
            into a questionnaire. All those not lucky enough to live in some
            sheltered reserve already know this, inasmuch as their actions are
            concerned: in response to threat we always adjust our actions
            before our theories. Yet it is only through reflection that we gain
            new security.</p>


        <p>Consequently, the voter we are considering here approaches the
            ballot box with a quite different feeling than his father or
            grandfather did. No doubt he would prefer to stay clear of it
            altogether, yet precisely that would be to express an unequivocal
            answer. On the other hand, if we take fingerprinting technology and
            cunning statistical methods into account, participation appears
            equally hazardous. Why then is he supposed to vote in a situation in
            which choice no longer exists?</p>


        <p>The answer is that the electoral ballot provides our voter an
            Opportunity to join in an act of approbation with his own
            contribution. Not all are deemed worthy of this privilege—indeed,
            the voting lists undoubtedly do not include the names of the
            unknown legion from which our modern slave armies are recruited.
            Our voter thus takes care to know what is expected of him.</p>


        <p>So far things are clear. In step with the development of
            dictatorships, free elections are replaced by plebiscites. The scope of
            the plebiscites, however, reaches beyond the sectors previously
            encompassed by the elections. The election becomes much more
            another form of plebiscite.</p>


        <p>Where the leaders or the symbols of the state are put on show, the
            plebiscite can take on a public character. The spectacle of great,
            passionately aroused masses is one of the most important signs of
            our entrance into a new era. Within these hypnotic spheres there
            reigns, if not unanimity, then certainly a single voice—because to
            raise a dissenting voice here would lead to uproar and the
            destruction of its owner. A single person seeking to make his
            presence felt in this manner might as well opt to attempt an
            assassination—it would lead to the same thing.</p>


        <p>Where a plebiscite is disguised as a form of free election, however, a
            point will be made to emphasize its confidential nature. In this way,
            the dictatorship attempts to produce proof not only of its support
            by an enormous majority but also of an approval grounded in the
            free will of individuals. The art of leadership rests not simply in
            asking questions in the right manner but also in the overall
            orchestration, which is monopolistic. Its task is to present the event
            as an overwhelming chorus, one that arouses terror and veneration.</p>


        <p>Thus far matters seem clear, though perhaps novel for an older
            observer. The voter finds himself faced with a question, and there
            are convincing grounds to recommend that he align his answer with
            the questioner’s goals. However, the real difficulty for the questioner
            here is that an illusion of freedom must simultaneously be
            maintained. Therewith, as with every moral process in these
            spheres, the question leads into statistics. We will further examine
            these details—they lead to our theme.</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="3">3</section>

        <p>From a technical perspective, elections in which a hundred percent
            of the votes are cast in the desired manner present no difficulties.
            This target was achieved from the start, even surpassed, since more
            votes than voters turned up in certain boroughs. Incidents like this
            point to mistakes in the orchestration, which not all populations can
            be expected to put up with. With subtler propagandists at the helm,
            the matter is as follows.</p>


        <p>One hundred percent: the ideal number, and, like all ideals, eternally
            unreachable. But it can be approached, as in sports, where certain
            limits, even unattainable ones, are approached by fractions of
            seconds or meters. How close an approach is allowable is in turn
            itself a function of a wealth of intricate deliberations.</p>


        <p>In places where a dictatorship is already firmly established, even a
            ninety percent affirmation would fall too far short. A secret enemy in
            every tenth person-this is a consideration that the masses cannot
            be asked to accept. On the other hand, a count of spoiled and nay
            votes around two percent would be not only tolerable but even
            favorable. Yet we will not write off these two percent as mere dead
            wood. They merit a closer look, for it is precisely in such residues
            that the unsuspected may be found today.</p>


        <p>From the organizer’s perspective these two votes have a double
            utility. In the first place, they validate the remaining ninety-eight
            percent of votes by showing that they too could have been cast as
            these two were. In this manner the endorsement gains value, is
            authenticated and fully validated. It is important for dictators to be
            able to show that the freedom to say no has not been extinguished
            under them. This attitude of theirs in fact conceals one of the
            greatest compliments that can be made to freedom.</p>


        <p>The second benefit of our two percent consists in their sustaining
            the uninterrupted movement that dictatorships rely on. It is for this</p>



        <p>reason that they continue to insist on presenting themselves as a
            “party, though it is meaningless. With a hundred percent the ideal
            would be achieved—and this would bring with it the dangers
            associated with every consummation. Even the laurels of civil war
            can be rested on. At the sight of all large fraternal gatherings, the
            question must be asked: And where is the enemy? For such large
            fusions are at the same time exclusions—exclusions of a despised
            third party, who is nonetheless indispensable. Propaganda relies on
            a situation in which the state enemy, the class enemy, the enemy of
            the people has been thoroughly beaten down and made almost
            ridiculous, yet not altogether eliminated.</p>


        <p>Dictatorships cannot survive on pure affirmation—they need hate,
            and with it terror, to provide a simultaneous counterbalance. With a
            hundred percent good votes the terror would become meaningless;
            one would encounter only the good and upright everywhere. This is
            the other significance of the two percent. They show that, although
            the good may be in the vast majority, they are not wholly out of
            danger. On the contrary, in view of such convincing unity it must be
            assumed that only an exceptional grade of impenitence can hold
            itself apart. These must be saboteurs of the ballot—and does it not
            then also stand to reason that they will progress to other kinds of
            sabotage when the opportunity arises?</p>


        <p>It is at this point that the electoral ballot becomes a questionnaire. It
            is unnecessary here to presume individual accountability for the
            supplied answers; yet we may be sure that numerical correlations
            exist. We may be certain that, by the logic of double-entry
            accounting, these two percent will reappear in other records than
            the election statistics, for instance in the registers of penitentiaries
            and penal labor camps, or in those places where God alone counts
            the victims.</p>


        <p>This is the other function that this tiny minority performs for the
            vast majority—the first, as we saw, consisted in lending value, indeed
            reality, to the ninety-eight percent. But, even more importantly, no
            one wants to be reckoned among the two percent, in which a dark </p>


        <p>taboo makes itself visible. On the contrary, everyone will make a
            point of letting his good vote be broadly known. And should he
            indeed belong to the two percent, he will keep his vote secret from
            even his best friends.</p>


        <p>A further benefit of this taboo consists in its action also against the
            category of non-voters. Non-participation is one of the attitudes
            that unsettles the Leviathan, though its potential is easily
            overestimated by outsiders. In the face of danger it quickly melts
            away. Near-perfect voter participation can therefore invariably be
            counted on, and the votes in favor of the questioner will scarcely be
            fewer.</p>


        <p>For the voter it will be important to be seen at the voting station. To
            be absolutely safe, he will also let a few acquaintances see his ballot
            before he puts it into the box. Ideally, this favor is performed
            reciprocally, providing mutually dependent witnesses that the
            crosses went in the right places. A wealth of instructive variations
            exist here, which a good European who has never had the chance to
            study such situations would never dream of. Among the recurring
            figures there is thus always the upright citizen who hands in his
            ballot with the words: “Couldn’t we just as well hand them in
            unfolded?" To which the electoral official responds, with a congenial,
            cryptic smile: “Yes, you’re right—but we shouldn’t really.’</p>


        <p>Visits to places like these sharpen the eye for studies of power
            questions. One homes in on one of the neural ganglia. However, it
            would lead too far afield to occupy ourselves here with the details of
            the arrangements. Let it suffice now to consider the singular figure
            of the man who enters such a place set on voting no.</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="4">4</section>

        <p>Our man’s intention may not be unique at all; it may be shared by
            many others, in all likelihood by significantly more than the
            mentioned two percent of the electorate. The orchestrators, by
            contrast, will try to dupe him into believing that he is very much
            alone. And not just that-—the majority should impose itself not
            merely numerically but also through signs of moral superiority.</p>


        <p>Let us assume that our voter, thanks to his powers of discrimination,
            has withstood the long, unambiguous propaganda campaign that has
            been astutely ramped up right until election day. This was no easy
            task. Now, on top of that, the statement required of him is clothed in
            highly respectable formulations: he is called on to participate in a
            vote for freedom, or perhaps a peace referendum. But who does not
            love peace and freedom? Only a monster. A nay vote already receives
            a criminal character here; and the bad voter resembles a criminal
            slinking up to the scene of a crime.</p>


        <p>How invigorating, on the other hand, the day is for the good voter.
            During breakfast, he received final encouragement, his final
            instructions, over the radio. Now he goes into the street, where a
            festive mood prevails. Banners hang from every house and every
            window. He is welcomed in the courtyard of the electoral station by
            a band playing marches. The musicians are in uniform, and there is
            no lack of uniforms in the voting hall either. In his enthusiasm it will
            escape the good voter that one can hardly still talk of voting booths
            here.</p>


        <p>On the other hand, it is precisely this circumstance that most
            absorbs the attention of the bad voter. He finds himself, pencil in
            hand, across from the electoral officials, whose presence
            disconcerts him. He makes his entry on a table that may, perhaps,
            still have the remnants of a green curtain around it. The
            arrangement has clearly been carefully thought through. It is
            unlikely that the point where he makes his cross can be seen;</p>


        <p>but can the opposite be altogether excluded? Just the day before he
            heard rumors that the ballot papers would receive numbers from
            ribbon-less typewriters. At the same time, he wants to ensure that
            the next voter in line cannot peer over his shoulder. On the wall a
            giant portrait of the head of state, also uniformed, stares down at
            him with a frozen smile.</p>

        <p>The ballot paper to which he now turns his attention also emanates
            suggestive power. It is the product of careful consideration. Under
            the words “Vote for Freedom” stands a large circle, with a
            superfluous arrow indicating: “Your Yes here." The small circle for
            No almost disappears next to it.</p>


        <p>The big moment has arrived—our voter makes his entry. Let us put
            ourselves in spirit into his position: he has actually voted no. In
            reality, this act is a point of intersection of a series of fictions that
            we have yet to investigate: the election, the voter, the electoral
            posters are labels for quite other processes and things. They are
            picture puzzles. During their ascent dictatorships owe their survival
            in large part to the fact that their hieroglyphs have yet to be
            deciphered. Later they too find their Champollion—and while he may
            not bring back the old freedom, he does teach how to answer
            correctly.</p>


        <p>It seems that our man has fallen into a trap. This makes his behavior
            no less admirable. Although his nay may issue from a lost cause, it
            will nevertheless have a persisting influence. Naturally, in places
            where the old world still basks in the warmth of the evening sun, on
            pleasant hillsides, on islands, or, in short, in milder climates, this
            voter will remain unnoticed. There it is the other ninety-eight of the
            hundred votes that make the impression. Since the cult of the
            majority has been long and ever more mindlessly celebrated, the two
            percent will be overlooked. Their role, by contrast, is to make the
            majority explicit and overpowering—because a hundred out of a
            hundred can no longer be called a majority.</p>


        <p>In countries where genuine elections still take place, such success
            will at first elicit amazement, adulation, also envy. If its impact
            extends into foreign affairs, these feelings may sour into hate and
            contempt. Here the two righteous souls—unlike with God and
            Sodom-—will be overlooked. Opinions will circulate that all there have
            sworn themselves to the devil and are ripe for a well-deserved fall.</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="5">5</section>

        <p>Let us now put aside the ninety-eight percent and turn to the
            residues, to the two grains of gold left in our sieve. To this end we
            step through the locked door behind which the votes are counted.
            Here we enter into one of the taboo zones of plebiscitary
            democracies, about which there exists only one official view but
            numerous whispered ones.</p>


        <p>The committee we meet here is also in uniform—though perhaps in
            shirtsleeves—and exudes a spirit of familiar sociability. It is
            composed of local representatives of the sole ruling power, plus
            propaganda experts and police. The atmosphere is that of a
            shopkeeper counting his take-not without suspense, since all
            present in the room are more or less responsible for the results. The
            yeas and nays are read out—the first with sympathetic, the second
            with malignant satisfaction. Then come the spoiled and empty
            ballots. The atmosphere becomes most uncomfortable when the
            epigram of some joker pops up-—certainly a rarity these days.</p>


        <p>Humor-together with the rest of freedom’s entourage—is absent in
            tyranny’s sphere of influence; yet the wit is all the more cutting
            when the joker puts his own head on the line.</p>


        <p>Let us suppose that in the location we find ourselves the
            propaganda, with all its intimidating effects, has been developed to
            relatively high levels. In this case, rumors will circulate in the
            population that a large number of nay votes were turned into yeas.
            In all likelihood this was not even necessary. The opposite may even
            have transpired, in that the interrogator had to invent nays to reach
            the numbers he was reckoning with. What is certain is that he gives
            the law to the voters, and not they him. The dethronement of the
            masses that emerged during the twentieth century becomes
            apparent here.</p>

        <p>Under these circumstances, finding only a single nay vote among the
            hundred in the box would already mean plenty. This vote’s holder
            can be expected to make sacrifices for his convictions and his
            conception of freedom and right.</p>
        
        <section class="chapter" id="6">6</section>

        <p>This vote-or rather, its holder-may also decide whether the
            constantly threatening condition of a termite state can be avoided.
            The accounts, which often seem so convincing to the spirit, will not
            work out at this spot, even if it is only a tiny fraction that remains
            over.</p>


        <p>It is thus a true form of resistance that we meet here, though one
            that is still ignorant of its own strength and the manner in which this
            should be exerted. By making his cross on the dangerous spot, our
            voter does precisely what his vastly superior opponent expects of
            him. It is, without doubt, the act of a brave man, but so too an act of
            one of the countless illiterates in the new questions of power. This is
            someone who must be helped.</p>


        <p>In sensing that he was falling into a trap in the polling station, our
            man correctly recognized his predicament. He was somewhere
            where the names no longer fit the things happening there. Above all,
            as we Saw, it was no longer a ballot slip but a questionnaire that he
            filled out, and with that he was no longer in a free relation but was
            instead confronted by his authorities. By making his cross, as one
            voter in a hundred, on the nay spot, he merely contributed to the
            official statistics. While endangering himself out of all proportion, he
            provided the desired data to his opponent, for whom a hundred
            percent of the votes would have been far more unsettling.</p>


        <p>But how should our man behave if he is to pass up the last possibility
            conceded him to express his views? With this question, we touch the
            borders of a new science-the teaching of human freedom in the
            face of changed forms of power. Though this will go far beyond our
            individual case here, let us pause to examine this case.</p>


        <p>The voter finds himself faced with a real dilemma, since he is invited
            to make a free decision by a power that for its part has no intention
            of playing by the rules. This same power demands his allegiance,</p>


        <p>while it survives on breaches of allegiance. He is essentially
            depositing his honest capital in a crooked bank. Who can then
            reproach him if he plays along with the questionnaire and keeps his
            nay to himself? This is his right, not only for reasons of self-
            preservation, but also because such conduct can reveal a contempt
            for the ruling powers that is even superior to a nay.</p>


        <p>This is not to say that our man’s nay must be lost to the external
            world. On the contrary—it must only not appear at the location that
            the ruling powers have picked out for it. There are other places
            where it can makes things significantly more uncomfortable for
            these powers—on the white border of an electoral poster, for
            instance, on a public telephone book, or on the side of a bridge that
            thousands cross every day. A few words there, such as “I said no,’
            would be far more effective.</p>


        <p>Something else from our own personal experience should be shared
            with the young man whom we are advising: “Last week, in a local
            tractor factory, the word ‘hunger’ was discovered written on a wall.
            The workers were assembled and their pockets emptied. One of the
            pencils that were discovered had traces of whitewash on its point”</p>


        <p>On the other hand, through the pressure they themselves create,
            dictatorships open up a series of weak points that simplify and
            condense the possibilities for attack. Sticking with our example,
            even the whole sentence above would not be necessary. A short “No”
            would suffice, because everyone whose eye it caught would know
            exactly what was meant. It would be a sign that the oppression had
            not entirely succeeded. Symbols stand out particularly well on
            monotoned backgrounds. The gray expanses correlate with a
            concentration into a minimized space.</p>


        <p>The signs can manifest as colors, figures, or objects. Where they
            have an alphabetic character, the script is transformed into
            pictography. In the process, it gains immediate life, becomes
            hieroglyphic, and now, rather than explaining, it offers subject
            matter requiring explanation. One could further abbreviate and, in</p>


        <p>the place of “No," simply use a single letter-say, an R. This could
            indicate: Reflect, Reject, React, Rearm, Resist. It could also mean:
            Rebel.</p>


        <p>This would be a first step out of the world of statistical surveillance
            and control. Yet the question at once arises if the individual is strong
            enough for such a venture</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="7">7</section>

        <p>There are two objections to consider at this point. The question
            could be raised if this single refusal registered on a ballot slip has
            any real meaning? On a higher moral plane such concerns have no
            place. A man expresses his view, in whichever forum it may be; he
            also accepts the possibility of downfall.</p>


        <p>There can be no objection to this position, although expecting it in
            practice would amount to an extinction of the elite, and there have
            indeed been cases where it was required in bad faith. No, a vote like
            this cannot be lost, even if it issues from a lost cause. Precisely this
            status gives it special meaning. It will not shake the opponent, but it
            will change the person who has decided to go through with it. Until
            now he was one supporter of a political conviction among all the
            others—in the face of the new abuses of power, he is transformed
            into a combatant who makes a personal sacrifice, perhaps even into
            a martyr. This transformation is independent of the content of his
            conviction—when the confrontation arrives, the old systems and the
            old parties are transformed along with the rest. They are unable find
            the way back to their ancestral freedom. A democrat who has cast a
            solitary vote for democracy against ninety-nine others has thereby
            departed not only from his own political system but also from his
            individuality. This has repercussions reaching far beyond the passing
            process, since there can now be neither democracy nor the
            individual in the old sense.</p>


        <p>This is why the numerous attempts under the Caesars to return to
            the republic had to fail. The republicans either fell in the civil war, or
            they came out of it transformed.</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="8">8</section>

        <p>The second objection is still more difficult to rebut-and some
            readers will already have come to it: why should only the single nay
            carry weight? Is it not conceivable that among the ninety-nine other
            votes there may be some that were cast out of full, sincere
            conviction, and with good reasons?</p>


        <p>In reality this is incontestable. We reach a point here at which any
            rapprochement seems impossible. The objection is valid, even if only
            a single genuine yea vote had been cast.</p>


        <p>Let us consider an ideal yea and an ideal nay. The dichotomy that
            the times bring with them becomes manifest in the holders of these
            two votes; it raises its pro and contra in the breast of each individual
            too. The yea would stand for necessity, the nay for freedom. The
            historical process is such that both powers, necessity and freedom,
            act upon it. It degenerates when one of the two is missing.</p>


        <p>Which of the two sides will be seen depends not only on the
            situation but above all on the observer. Nevertheless, he will always
            be able to sense the opposite side. He will be limited in his freedom
            by necessity, yet just through this freedom can he confer a
            characteristic style upon the necessary. This creates the gap by
            which men and peoples are either adequate to the times or are
            wrecked on them.</p>


        <p>In the forest passage we consider the freedom of the individual in
            this world. An account must additionally be given of the difficulty—
            indeed of the merit—of managing to be an individual in this world.
            There can be no disputing that the world has changed and continues
            to change, and that by necessity; yet freedom thereby also changes,
            not in its essence but in its form. We live in the age of the Worker;
            since its conception this thesis can only have become more
            apparent. The forest passage establishes the movement within this
            order that differentiates it from zoological formations. Neither an any
            liberal act nor a romantic one, it is rather the arena of a small elite,
            which knows what the times demand, and something more.</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="9">9</section>

        <p>Our solitary voter is not yet a forest rebel. From a_ historical
            perspective he is even in arrears; his act of negation itself indicates
            this. Only when he has gained an overview of the game can he come
            up with his own, perhaps even surprising, moves.</p>


        <p>To gain this vantage point he must first abandon the framework of
            the old majority conceptions, which continue to operate, despite
            having been thoroughly seen through by Burke and Rivarol. In that
            framework a minority of one percent is quite meaningless. As we
            Saw, it simply serves to confirm the overwhelming majority.</p>


        <p>This all changes the moment we abandon the statistics and turn to
            evaluative considerations. In this regard the solitary vote sets itself
            so far apart from all others that it even determines their market
            value. We may assume that this voter is not only capable of forming
            his own opinions, but that he also knows how to stand by them.
            Thus we can additionally concede our man courage. If there are still
            individuals to be found who are able, during long periods of the
            absolute dominion of violence, to preserve a notion of justice, even
            in the role of victim, then it is here that we must look. Even where
            they are silent, like submerged boulders in the stream they always
            generate a certain agitation in their vicinity. Their example shows
            that a predominating force, even one that changes history, is
            incapable of creating justice.</p>


        <p>Viewing the matter from this angle, it appears that the power of an
            individual in the midst of the undifferentiated masses is not
            inconsiderable. One must remember that such an individual is
            almost always surrounded by others, whom he influences and who
            share in his fate if he falls. These others are also different from the
            members of a bourgeois family or from good friends from the past—
            stronger bonds are at work here.</p>


        <p>The consequence is no longer merely the resistance of one in a
            hundred voters but of one in a hundred citizens. Though this
            calculation does have the flaw of including children, it is also true
            that in civil war people come of age, become responsible younger.
            Then again, the figure can also be set higher in lands that enjoy a
            venerable legal tradition. However, we are no longer dealing with
            numerical ratios here, but rather with a concentration of being, and
            with that we enter a different order. In this new order it makes no
            difference whether the voice of one individual contradicts a hundred
            or a thousand others. So too, his judgment, his will, and his effect
            can outweigh that of ten, twenty, or a thousand other men. The
            moment he decides to take the risk and abandon the realm of
            Statistics, the senselessness of these pursuits, which lie far from the
            origins, will become clear to him.</p>


        <p>Let it suffice us here to assume the existence in a city of ten
            thousand inhabitants of a hundred individuals resolved on putting an
            end to the violence. A city of a million will then house a thousand
            forest rebels—if we are to use this name before gaining an idea of its
            full import. This is a mighty force, sufficient to topple even powerful
            oppressors. For dictatorships are not only dangerous, they are at the
            same time endangered, since the brutal deployment of force also
            arouses broad resentment. Under these circumstances the
            resolution of even a small minority becomes cause for concern,
            especially if it develops a line of attack.</p>


        <p>This explains the tremendous growth of police forces. At a first
            glance, the expansion of police forces into regular armies in lands
            with overpowering popular approval quotas may seem incongruous.
            It can only be an indication that the power of the minority has
            grown in the same relation. This is the case. Resistance should be
            expected under all circumstances from anyone who has dared to
            voted no in a so-called peace ballot—particularly if the ruling power
            gets into difficulties. By contrast, when things do start to get shaky,
            the continued support of the ninety-nine others can by no means be
            counted on with the same certainty. In such cases the minority is
            like a chemical reagent of vigorous and unforeseeable potency that
            percolates through the state.</p>


        <p>To investigate, observe, and control these points of precipitation,
            large numbers of police are required. The mistrust grows with the
            approval—as the fraction of good votes approaches one hundred
            percent, the number of suspects only grows, since it must then be
            assumed that the agents of resistance have switched from a
            statistically determinable order to the invisible one we have
            characterized as the forest passage. Now an eye must be kept on
            everyone. The reconnaissance effort drives its organs into every city
            block, into every dwelling. It even tries to infiltrate the family, and its
            supreme victories come in the self-incriminations of the great show
            trials: we see the individual stepping up as his own policeman and
            contributing to his own elimination. No longer is he indivisible, as in
            the liberal world; rather, he is dissected by the state into two halves
            —a guilty one and another that denounces itself.</p>


        <p>What a strange sight these proud, strutting states make: armed to
            the teeth and possessing all possible instruments of power, they are
            at the same time acutely sensitive. The care and attention they have
            to dedicate to their police forces diminishes their external power.
            The police erode the allocations for the army, and not only the
            allocations. Were the great masses as transparent, as aligned in their
            atoms as the propaganda claims, then no more police would be
            necessary than a shepherd needs dogs for his flock of sheep. But
            that is not the case, for there are wolves hiding in the gray flock—
            that is, characters who still know what freedom is. Moreover, these
            wolves are not only strong in themselves; there is also the danger
            that one fine morning they will transmit their characteristics to the
            masses, so that the flock turns into a pack. This is a ruler’s
            nightmare.</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="10">10</section>

        <p>A peculiar characteristic of our times is the combination of
            significant scenes with insignificant actors. This becomes apparent
            above all in our important men; the impression is of figures that one
            might encounter in any number in a Genevan or Viennese café, in a
            provincial officers’ mess, or some obscure caravansary. Where
            intellectual traits show up that go beyond pure willpower, we can
            assume the survival of some older substance, as for instance in
            Clemenceau who may be characterized as dyed-in-the-wool.</p>


        <p>The bothersome aspect of this spectacle is the association of such
            trivial stature with such enormous functional power. These are the
            men who make the masses tremble, whose decisions determine the
            fate of millions.</p>


        <p>Yet one must concede the zeitgeist an infallible hand in picking out
            just these characters—if we consider it in just one of its possible
            aspects, that of a mighty demolition enterprise. All the
            expropriations, devaluations, equalizations, liquidations,
            rationalizations, socializations, electrifications, land reallocations,
            redistributions, and pulverizations presuppose neither character nor
            cultivation, which would both actually impede the automatism.
            Consequently, where positions of power open up in our industrial
            landscapes, we observe those individuals winning the contracts
            whose personal insignificance is inflated by a strong will. Later we
            will pick up this theme again, particularly in its moral connections.</p>


        <p>However, as the action begins to degenerate psychologically, so it
            becomes typologically more meaningful. Man enters into new
            relations, which he does not at first grasp with his consciousness, let
            alone through their configuration—an eye for the meaning of the
            scene comes only with time. And only then does sovereignty become
            possible: a process must first be comprehended before it can be
            acted upon.</p>


        <p>With the catastrophes we see figures emerging, which prove
            themselves equal to the cataclysms and which will outlive them
            when the incidental names have been long forgotten. Among these
            figures is, first and foremost, that of the Worker, marching
            confidently and unswervingly toward its goals. The fires of downfall
            only serve to throw it into an ever brighter light. For the moment it
            still radiates an ambiguous titanic glow; we cannot yet guess the
            royal capitals, the cosmic metropolises in which it will erect its
            thrones. The world wears its uniform and its armor, and at some
            point it will also don its festival attire. Since it is only at the start of
            its career, comparisons with any previously accomplished states
            would be improper.</p>


        <p>In its train other figures surface, including those in which the
            suffering is sublimated. One of these is the Unknown Soldier, the
            Nameless, who for just this reason lives not only in every capital but
            also in every village, in every family. The battlefields, the temporal
            goals, and even the peoples he has represented sink into the realm
            of the uncertain. As the conflagrations cool, something else remains,
            a shared something, and now it is no longer will and passion but art
            and worship that turn to it.</p>


        <p>Why is it that this second figure is so clearly connected in our
            memory with the First but not the Second World War? This comes
            from the clear delineations that emerged from that point forward of
            the forms and goals of the global civil war. The soldierly aspect fell
            therewith into second rank. Yet the Unknown Soldier remains a
            hero, a conqueror of fiery worlds, who shoulders great burdens in
            the midst of the mechanical devastation. In this sense he is also a
            true descendant of western chivalry.</p>


        <p>The Second World War is distinguished from the First not only
            because the national questions mix openly with and subordinate
            themselves to those of civil war, but also due to the escalated
            mechanical development, which approaches extreme limits of
            automatism. This brings with it intensified assaults on nomos and
            ethos. In this connection, utterly hopeless encirclements result from
            overwhelming superior forces. The material battle escalates into one
            of encirclement and annihilation, into a Cannae without the ancient
            grandeur. The suffering increases in a manner that must necessarily
            exclude any heroic element.</p>


        <p> all strategic figures, this one too provides an exact picture of
            the times, which seek to resolve their issues with fire. The hopeless
            encirclement of man has been long in the preparation, through
            theories that strive for a logical and seamless explanation of the
            world and go hand in hand with technical development. At first
            there is the rational encirclement of the opponent, then the societal
            one; finally, at the appointed hour, he is exterminated. No more
            desperate fate exists than getting mixed up in a process where the
            law has been turned into a weapon.</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="11">11</section>

        <p>Such phenomena have always been part of human history, and one
            could reckon them among the atrocities that are seldom absent
            wherever great changes are taking place. What is more unsettling in
            the present case is that the brutality is threatening to become an
            element, a constitutive part of the new power structures, and that
            we See the individual placed helplessly at their mercy.</p>


        <p>There are a number of reasons for this, above all that rational
            thought is by its nature cruel. This finds its way into the planning.
            The elimination of free competition plays a special role in this
            process, and it brings forth a peculiar mirror image. As the name
            Says, competition resembles a race, in which the most able wins the
            prize. Where the competitive element lapses, the threat arises of a
            sort of retirement at state expense, even as the external
            competition, the race between states, remains. It is terror that fills
            the resulting gap. To be sure, other circumstances precipitate the
            terror, and one of the reasons it endures reveals itself here: the high
            speed, initially induced by the competition, must now be maintained
            by fear. Initially, the standard depended on a high pressure, now it
            depends on a vacuum. Initially, the winning party set the pace, now
            the person who is even worse off.</p>


        <p>In this connection, the state sees itself forced in the second case to
            permanently subjugate a part of the population to gruesome
            assaults. Life may have become gray, but it may still appear tolerable
            to those who see only darkness, utter blackness beside them. Here—
            and not in the economic realm-—lie the dangers of the grand designs.</p>


        <p>The choice of class to be persecuted is arbitrary; it will, in any case,
            be minorities that are either naturally distinct or artificial
            constructions. All those set apart by either their heritage or their
            talents will obviously be endangered. This climate carries over into
            the treatment of the defeated in wartime; accusations of collective
            guilt are followed by starvation in prison camps, forced labor, extermination in broad regions, and forced
            expulsion of any
            survivors.</p>



         <p>It is understandable that people in such predicaments would rather
            take on the most grievous burdens than be counted among the
            “others." The automatism seems to effortlessly break down any
            remnants of free will, and the persecution concentrates and
            becomes as ubiquitous as an element. For a privileged few flight may
            remain an option, though it usually leads to something worse.
            Resistance only seems to invigorate the ruling powers, providing
            them a welcome opportunity to take offensive action. In the face of
            all this, the only remaining hope is that the process will be self-
            consuming, as a volcano exhausts itself in erupting. In the meantime,
            for the besieged, there can only be two concerns at this point in the
            game: meeting obligations and not deviating from the norm. The
            effects carry over into the sphere of security, where people are
            stricken by an apocalyptic panic.</p>


        <p>It is at this point that the question arises, not merely theoretically
            but in every human existence today, whether another path remains
            viable. After all, there are mountain passes and mule tracks that one
            discovers only after a long ascent. A new conception of power has
            emerged, a potent and direct concentration. Holding out against this
            force requires a new conception of freedom, one that can have
            nothing to do with the washed-out ideas associated with this word
            today. It presumes, for a start, that one does not want to merely save
            one’s own skin, but is also willing to risk it.</p>


        <p>Indeed, we see that even in these states with their overpowering
            police forces not all movement has died out. The armor of the new
            Leviathans has its own weak points, which must continually be felt
            out, and this assumes both caution and daring of a previously
            unknown quality. We may imagine an elite opening this battle for a
            new freedom, a battle that will demand great sacrifices and which
            should leave no room for any interpretations that are unworthy of it.
            To find good comparisons we need to look back to the gravest of
            times and places—for instance to the Huguenots, or to the Guerrillas</p>


        <p>as Goya pictured them in his Desastres. By contrast, the storm of the
            Bastille, which still nourishes the awareness of individual freedom
            today, was a Sunday walk in the park.</p>


        <p>Fundamentally, freedom and tyranny cannot be considered in
            isolation, although we observe them succeeding each other in time.
            It can clearly be said that tyranny suppresses and eliminates
            freedom—but, on the other hand, tyranny is only possible where
            freedom has been domesticated and has evaporated into vacuous
            concepts.</p>


        <p>In general, man will tend to rely on the system or yield to it even
            when he should already be drawing on his own resources. This
            shows a lack of fantasy. He should know at what points he must not
            be induced to give up his sovereign power of decision. As long as
            things are in order, there will be water in the pipes and electricity in
            the lines. When life and property are threatened, an alarm call will
            summon the fire department and police. But the great danger is that
            man relies too heavily on this assistance and becomes helpless when
            it fails to materialize. Every comfort must be paid for. The condition
            of the domesticated animal drags behind it that of the
            slaughterhouse animal.</p>


        <p>Catastrophes test the degree to which men and peoples are still
            natively grounded. At least one root thread must still connect
            directly with the earth—our health and our prospects for a life
            beyond civilization and its insurances depend on this connection.</p>

        <p>This becomes evident in phases of extreme threat, during which the
            apparatus not only leaves man high and dry but encircles him in a
            manner that appears to dash all hopes of escape. At this point the
            individual must decide whether to give up the game or persevere
            from his own innermost forces. In the latter case he opts for a forest
            passage.</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="12">12</section>

        <p>We previously referred to the Worker and the Unknown Soldier as
            two of the significant figures of our times. In the forest rebel we
            conceive a third figure, one that is emerging ever more clearly.</p>

        <p>In the Worker the active principle is deployed in an attempt to
            pervade and master the universe in a new manner, to reach places,
            near and far, which no eye has ever seen, to command forces that
            none have ever before unleashed. In the shadow of these actions
            stands the Unknown Soldier, as sacrificial victim, who shoulders the
            burden across vast wastelands of fire, and who, as good and unifying
            Spirit, is invoked not only within a people but also between peoples.
            He is the immediate son of the earth.</p>


        <p>But, in our terms, the forest rebel is that individual who, isolated and
            uprooted from his homeland by the great process, sees himself
            finally delivered up for destruction. This could be the fate of many,
            indeed of all—another factor must therefore be added to the
            definition: this is the forest rebel’s determination to resist, and his
            intention to fight the battle, however hopeless. The forest rebel thus
            possesses a primal relationship to freedom, which, in the
            perspective of our times, is expressed in his intention to oppose the
            automatism and not to draw its ethical conclusion, which is fatalism.</p>


        <p>Considered in this manner, it becomes clear what role the forest
            passage plays, not merely in the thoughts but also in the reality of
            these years. Everyone finds themselves trapped in a predicament
            today, and the attempts we see to hold this coercion at bay resemble
            bold experiments upon which a far more significant destiny depends
            than that of those who have resolved to risk the experiment.</p>


        <p>A gamble of this kind can only hope to succeed if the three great
            powers of art, philosophy, and theology come to its aid and break
            fresh ground in the dead-end situation. We will explore each of
            these themes individually. For the moment we will only say that in
            art the theme of the beleaguered individual is indeed gaining
            ground. This naturally emerges in particular in character portrayals,
            and in their adaptations to the stage and cinema but above all to the
            novel. Indeed, the perspectives are visibly changing as depictions of
            an advancing or disintegrating society are replaced by the
            individual’s conflict with the technical collective and its world. In
            penetrating the depths of this world, the author himself becomes a
            forest rebel—because authorship is really only another name for
            independence.</p>


        <p>A direct thread leads from these descriptions to Edgar Allan Poe.
            The extraordinary element in this mind is its thrift. We hear the
            leitmotif even before the curtain lifts, and with the first bars we
            realize that the scene will become sinister. The concise
            mathematical figures are at once also figures of destiny; that is the
            source of their tremendous fascination.</p>


        <p>In the maelstrom we have the funnel, the irresistible suck of
            emptiness, of the void. The pit provides a picture of the cauldron, of
            the relentlessly tightening encirclement, which constricts space and
            drives us onto the rats. And the pendulum is a symbol of dead,
            measurable time. At its end is Chronos’s sharpened sickle, which
            swings back and forth and threatens the enchained captive, but
            which can also free him if he knows how to make use of it for
            himself.</p>


        <p>Since then the bare grid has been filled out with oceans and
            continents. Historical experience has also been added. The
            increasingly artificial cities, the automatized traits, the wars and civil
            wars, the machine infernos, the gray despots, the prisons and the
            refined persecutions—all these have since been given names, and
            they occupy man’s thoughts day and night. We see him as bold
            planner and thinker, brooding over progress but also its exit
            strategies; we see him in action as a machine operator, combatant,
            prisoner, or partisan in the heart of his cities, which at one moment
            are in flames, at the next bright with carnival lights. We see him as a
            “
            scoffer of values and as a cold calculator—but then in despair when,
            from the depths of the labyrinth, his gaze searches for the stars.
            "</p>

        <p>The process has two poles—on one side there is the whole, striding
            in progressively more powerful formations through all resistance.
            This is the pole of consummated actions, of imperial expansion and
            perfect security. At the other pole there is the individual, suffering
            and defenseless, and in an equally perfect state of insecurity. Each
            pole conditions the other, since the vast unfolding of power subsists
            on fear, and the coercion is most effective where the sensitivity has
            become acute.</p>


        <p>countless attempts of art to assume and tackle this new
            situation of man as its bonafide theme go beyond mere descriptions.
            Rather, they are experiments with the supreme goal of uniting
            freedom and the world in a new harmony. Where this succeeds in an
            artwork, the pent-up fear must dissipate like fog with the first rays
            of the morning sun.</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="13">13</section>

        <p>Fear is symptomatic of our times—and it is all the more disturbing as
            it comes on the heels of an epoch of great individual freedom, in
            which hardships of the kind portrayed by Dickens were already
            virtually forgotten.</p>

        <p>How did such a shift come about? If we want to pick out a turning
            point none could be more appropriate than the day the Titanic went
            down. Here light and shadow collide starkly: the hubris of progress
            with panic, the highest comfort with destruction, and automatism
            with a catastrophe manifested as a traffic accident.</p>


        <p>In fact, the growing automatism is closely connected with the fear,
            in the sense that man restricts his own power of decision in favor of
            technological expediencies. This brings all manner of conveniences—
            but an increasing loss of freedom must necessarily also result. The
            individual no longer stands in society like a tree in the forest;
            instead, he resembles a passenger on a fast-moving vessel, which
            could be called Titanic, or also Leviathan. While the weather holds
            and the outlook remains pleasant, he will hardly perceive the state of
            reduced freedom that he has fallen into. On the contrary, an
            optimism arises, a sense of power produced by the high speed. All
            this will change when fire-spitting islands and icebergs loom on the
            horizon. Then, not only does technology step over from the field of
            comfort into very different domains, but the lack of freedom
            simultaneously becomes apparent—be it in a triumph of elemental
            powers, or in the fact that any individuals who have remained strong
            command an absolute authority.</p>


        <p>The details are well known and well described; they belong to our
            own-most experiences. It may be objected here that other times of
            fear, of apocalyptic panic, have existed that were not accompanied
            and orchestrated by this automatic character. We leave the question
            open here, since the automatism only takes on a frightening aspect
            when it reveals itself as one of the forms, as the style, of the
            cataclysm—as Hieronymus Bosch so unsurpassably depicted it.
            Whether our modern instance represents a very unusual kind of fear
            or whether it is simply the return of one and the same cosmic
            anxiety in the style of the times—we will not pause on this but will
            rather raise the opposite question, which we think of crucial
            importance: Might it be possible to lessen the fear even as the
            automatism progresses or, as can be foreseen, approaches
            perfection? Would it not be possible to both remain on the ship and
            retain one’s autonomy of decision—that is, not only to preserve but
            even to strengthen the roots that are still fixed in the primal
            ground? This is the real question of our existence.</p>


        <p> It is this same question that is concealed behind all the fears of our
            times: man wants to know how he can escape destruction. These
            days, when we sit down with acquaintances or strangers anywhere
            in Europe, the conversation soon turns to general concerns—and
            then the whole misery emerges. It becomes apparent that practically
            all of these men and women are in the grip of the kind of panic that
            has been unknown here since the early Middle Ages. We observe
            them plunging obsessively into their fears, whose symptoms are
            revealed openly and without embarrassment. We are witness to a
            contest of minds arguing about whether it would be better to flee,
            hide, or commit suicide, and who, in the possession of full liberty,
            are already considering the means and wiles they will employ to win
            the favor of the base when it comes to power. With horror we also
            sense that there is no infamy they will not consent to if it is
            demanded of them. Among them will be healthy, strapping men,
            built like athletes. The question must be asked: why do they bother
            with sports?</p>


        <p>However, these same men are not just fearful-they are also
            fearsome. The sentiment changes from fear to open hate the
            moment they notice a weakening in those they feared only a
            moment before. It is not only in Europe that one comes across such
            congregations. Where the automatism increases to the point of
            approaching perfection—such as in America—the panic is even
            further intensified. There it finds its best feeding grounds; and it is
            propagated through networks that operate at the speed of light. The
            need to hear the news several times a day is already a sign of fear;
            the imagination grows and paralyzes itself in a rising vortex. The
            myriad antennae rising above our megacities resemble hairs
            standing on end—they provoke demonic contacts.</p>


        <p>Of course, the East is not an exception in this. The West is afraid of
            the East, the East afraid of the West. Everywhere on the planet
            people live in daily expectation of terrifying attacks, and in many
            places there is also the fear of civil war.</p>


        <p>The crude political mechanism is not the only cause of this fear.
            There are countless other anxieties; they bring with them an
            uncertainty that constantly sets its hopes on doctors, saviors, and
            miracle workers. Everything can become an object of fear. The
            emergence of this condition is a clearer omen of downfall than any
            physical danger.</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="14">14</section>

        <p>The basic question in this vortex is whether man can be liberated
            from fear. This is far more important than arming or supplying him
            with medicines—for power and health are prerogatives of the
            unafraid. In contrast, the fear besets even those armed to the teeth—
            indeed, them above all. The same may be said for those on whom
            abundance has been rained. The threat cannot be exorcized by
            weapons or fortunes—these are no more than means.</p>


        <p>Fear and danger are so closely correlated that it is hardly possible to
            say which of the two powers generates the other. Since fear is the
            more important, we must begin there if we are to loosen the knot.</p>


        <p>Here we should also caution against the opposite idea—that is, of
            starting with the danger. Aiming simply to become more dangerous
            than one’s feared opponent leads to no solution—this is the classic
            relationship between reds and whites, reds and reds, and tomorrow
            perhaps between whites and non-whites. Terror is a fire that wants
            to consume the whole world. All the while the fears multiply and
            diversify. The ruler by calling proves himself such by ending the
            terror. It is the person who has first conquered his own fear.</p>


        <p>Moreover, it is important to know that fear will not permit itself to
            be banished absolutely. This also would not lead out of the
            automatism; on the contrary, it would convey the fear into man’s
            inner being. When a man turns for counsel to his own heart, fear is
            always his principal partner in the dialogue. It will attempt to make
            the conversation a monologue, for only in this way can it have the
            last word.</p>


        <p>If, on the other hand, the fear can be forced back into a dialogue,
            then man can also have his say. The illusion of encirclement will also
            disappear therewith, and another solution will always become visible
            beyond the automatic one. Two paths will then be possible-or, in
            other words, free choice will have been restored.</p>


        <p>Even assuming the worst possible scenario of total ruin, a difference
            would remain like that between night and day. The one path climbs
            to higher realms, to self-sacrifice, or to the fate of those who fall
            with weapon in hand; the other sinks into the abysses of slave pens
            and slaughterhouses, where primitive beings are wed in a
            murderous union with technology. There are no longer destinies
            there—there are only numbers. To have a destiny, or to be classified
            as a number-this decision is forced upon all of us today, and each of
            us must face it alone. The individual today is as sovereign as an
            individual in any other period of history, perhaps even stronger,
            because as collective powers gain ground, so the individual is
            separated from the old established associations and must stand for
            himself alone. He becomes Leviathan’s antagonist, indeed his
            conqueror and his tamer.</p>


        <p>Let us return to the image of the election. The electoral mechanism,
            as we Saw, has been transformed into an automatized concert under
            the direction of its organizer. The individual can—and will—be
            compelled to take part. He must only remember that all the possible
            positions he can assume on this field are equally null and void. Once
            cornered, it makes no difference whether the game runs to this or
            that spot in the net.</p>


        <p>The locus of freedom is to be found elsewhere than in mere
            opposition, also nowhere that any flight can lead to. We have called
            it the forest. There, other instruments exist than a nay scribbled in
            its prescribed circle. Of course, we have also seen that in the state to
            which things have now advanced perhaps only one in a hundred is
            capable of a forest passage. But numerical ratios are irrelevant here—
            in a theater blaze it takes one clear head, a single brave heart, to
            check the panic of a thousand others who succumb to an animalistic
            fear and threaten to crush each other.</p>


        <p>In speaking of the individual here, we mean the human being, but
            without the overtones that have accrued to the word over the past
            two centuries. We mean the free human being, as God created him.
            This person is not an exception, he represents no elite. Far more, he
            is concealed in each of us, and differences only arise from the
            varying degrees that individuals are able to effectuate the freedom
            that has been bestowed on them. In this he needs help-the help of
            thinkers, knowers, friends, lovers.</p>


        <p>We might also say that man sleeps in the forest—and the moment he
            awakens to recognize his own power, order is restored. The higher
            rhythm present in history as a whole may even be interpreted as
            man’s periodic rediscovery of himself. In all epochs there will be
            powers that seek to force a mask on him, at times totemic powers, at
            times magical or technical ones. Rigidity then increases, and with it
            fear. The arts petrify, dogma becomes absolute. Yet, since time
            immemorial, the spectacle also repeats of man removing the mask,
            and the happiness that follows is a reflection of the light of freedom.</p>


        <p>Under the spell of powerful optical illusions we have become
            accustomed to viewing man as a grain of sand next to his machines
            and apparatuses. But the apparatuses are, and will always be, no
            more than a stage set for a low-grade imagination. As man has
            constructed them, so he can break them down or integrate them
            into new orders of meaning. The chains of technology can be broken
            —and it is the individual that has this power.</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="15">15</section>

        <p>A potential error remains to be indicated here-that of a reliance on
            pure imagination. Although we will not deny that it is imagination
            which leads the spirit to victory, the issue cannot be reduced to the
            founding of yoga schools. This is the vision not only of countless
            sects but also of a form of Christian nihilism that oversimplifies the
            matter for its own convenience. For we cannot limit ourselves to
            knowing what is good and true on the top floors while fellow human
            beings are being flayed alive in the cellar. This would also be
            unacceptable if our position were not merely spiritually secure but
            also spiritually superior—because the un-heard suffering of the
            enslaved millions cries out to the heavens. The vapors of the flayers’
            huts still hang in the air today; on such things there must be no
            deceiving ourselves.</p>


        <p>Thus, it is not given to us to loiter in the imagination, even if
            imagination provides the basic force for the action. Any power
            struggle is preceded by a verification of images and an iconoclasm.
            This is why we need poets-they initiate the overthrow, even that of
            titans. Imagination, and with it song, belong to the forest passage.</p>


        <p>To come back to the second of the images we are employing: The
            historical world in which we find ourselves resembles a fast-moving
            vehicle, which at one moment presents its comfort aspects, at the
            next its horror aspects. It is the Titanic, and it is Leviathan. Since a
            moving object attracts the eye, it will remain concealed to most of
            the ship’s guests that they simultaneously exist in another realm, a
            realm of perfect stillness. This second realm is so superior as to
            contain the first within it like a plaything, as merely one of
            innumerable other manifestations. This second realm is the harbor,
            our homeland, the peace and security that everyone carries within
            them. We call it the forest.</p>


        <p>Sea voyage and forest—uniting such disparate elements in an image
            may seem difficult. But myth is well-acquainted with such opposites
            —Dionysus, abducted by Tyrrhenian pirates, made grapevines and
            ivy entangle the ship’s rudder and grow up over the mast. Then a
            tiger leaped from the thicket to tear apart the hijackers.</p>

        <p>Myth is not prehistory; it is timeless reality, which repeats itself in
            history. We may consider our own century’s rediscovery of meaning
            in myth as a favorable sign. Today, too, man has been conducted by
            powerful forces far out onto the ocean, deep into the deserts with
            their mask worlds. The journey will lose its threatening aspect the
            moment man recollects his own divine power.</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="16">16</section>

        <p>There are two facts we need to know and accept if we are to escape
            the pattern of moves that is forced on us and play our own higher
            game. First, we need to understand—as in the example of the
            elections—that only a small fraction of the great masses will be able
            to defy the mighty fictions of the times and the intimidation that
            emanates from them. Of course, this fraction can operate in a
            representative role. Second, as we saw in the example of the ship,
            the powers of the present will be insufficient to set up a resistance.</p>


        <p>These two statements contain nothing new. They are in the nature
            of things and will always impose themselves anew when
            catastrophes announce themselves. In such situations, the initiative
            will always pass into the hands of a select minority who prefer
            danger to servitude. And their action will always be preceded by
            reflection. This reflection is expressed, first, as a critique of the
            current epoch-that is, as a recognition of the inadequacy of the
            current values—and later, as retrospection. If the retrospection is
            directed at the fathers and their systems, which lie closer to the
            origins, it will seek a conservative restoration. But in times of still
            greater danger the salvific power must be sought deeper, in the
            mothers. This contact liberates primal forces, to which the mere
            powers of time cannot stand up.</p>


        <p> Characteristics are thus essential for the forest rebel: he allows
            no superior power to dictate the law to him, neither through
            propaganda nor force; and he means to defend himself, not only by
            exploiting the instruments and ideas of the times, but also by
            maintaining access to those time-transcending powers that can
            never be reduced to pure movement. Then he can risk the passage.</p>


        <p>A question arises here about the purpose of such an undertaking. As
            we previously suggested, it cannot be limited to the conquest of
            purely interior realms. This is one of the notions that becomes
            popular in the wake of defeat. Equally unsatisfactory would be a
            limitation to purely concrete goals, such as conducting a national
            liberation struggle. Rather, as we shall see, these efforts are also
            crowned by national freedom, which joins as an additional factor.
            After all, we are involved not simply in a national collapse but in a
            global catastrophe, in which the real winners and losers can hardly
            be known, let alone prophesied.</p>


        <p>It is rather the case that the ordinary man on the street, whom we
            meet everywhere, everyday, grasps the situation better than any
            regime and any theoretician. This ability stems from the surviving
            traces in him of a knowledge reaching deeper than all the platitudes
            of the times. It also explains why resolutions can be made at
            conferences and congresses that are much stupider and more
            dangerous than the candid opinion of the first random person
            stepping out of the next streetcar.</p>


        <p>The individual still possesses organs in which more wisdom lives
            than in the entire organization—his very bewilderment, his fear,
            demonstrate this. In agonizing about finding a way out, an escape
            route, he exhibits a behavior appropriate to the proximity and
            magnitude of the threat. If he is skeptical about the currency and
            wants to get to the bottom of things, then he is simply conducting
            himself as someone who still knows the difference between gold and
            printer’s ink. And if he awakens at night in terror—in a rich and
            peaceful country at that—this is as natural a reaction as someone’s
            head reeling at the brink of an abyss. There is no point in trying to
            convince him that the abyss is not there at all. Indeed, the edge of
            the abyss is a good place to seek our own counsel.</p>


        <p>How does man behave in the face of and within the catastrophe?
            This theme presents itself more urgently with each passing day. All
            the questions can be resolved into this single, most fundamental
            one. Even within groups of people that seem to be reciprocally
            conspiring against each other, the considerations basically revolve
            around this one same threat.
        </p>

        <p>Whatever the case, it is useful to keep the catastrophe in view, as
            well as the ways in which one may get entangled in it. It is a good
            intellectual exercise. If we tackle it in the right manner, the fear will
            diminish, and this represents the first meaningful step toward
            security. The effect is not just personally beneficial; it is also
            preventive, since the probability of catastrophe diminishes in step
            with the individual’s victory over fear.</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="17">17</section>

        <p>The ship signifies being in time, the forest supra-temporal being. In
            our nihilistic period, an optical illusion grows whereby the moving
            appears to increase at the expense of the resting. In truth, all the
            technical power that we see presently unfolding is but a fleeting
            shimmer from the treasure chests of being. If a man succeeds in
            accessing them, even for one immeasurable instant, he will gain new
            security—the things of time will not only lose their threatening
            aspect but appear newly meaningful.</p>


        <p>Let us call this turn the Forest Passage, and the person who
            accomplishes it the Forest Rebel. Like Worker, this word also
            encompasses a spectrum of meaning, since it can designate not only
            very divergent forms and fields but also different levels of a single
            deportment. Although we will further refine the expression here, it
            is helpful that it already has a history in old Icelandic vocabulary. A
            forest passage followed a banishment; through this action a man
            declared his will to self-affirmation from his own resources. This
            was considered honorable, and it still is today, despite all the
            platitudes.</p>


        <p>In those times, the banishment was usually the consequence of a
            homicide, whereas today it happens to a man automatically, like the
            turning of a roulette wheel. None of us can know today if tomorrow
            morning we will not be counted as part of a group considered
            outside the law. In that moment the civilized veneer of life changes,
            as the stage props of well-being disappear and are transformed into
            omens of destruction. The luxury liner becomes a battleship, or the
            black jolly roger and the red executioner’s flag are hoisted on it.</p>


        <p>In our ancestors’ times, anyone banished was already accustomed to
            thinking for themselves, accustomed to a hard life, and to acting
            autonomously. Even in later times this person probably still felt
            strong enough within to take the banishment in stride and assume
            for himself not only the roles of warrior, physician, and judge, but
            also priest. Things are different today. People are incorporated into
            the collective structures in a manner that makes them very
            defenseless indeed. They hardly realize how irresistibly powerful the
            prejudices have become in our enlightened epoch. Additionally there
            is our whole living off of processed foods, communication
            connections, and utility hookups; and all the synchronizations,
            repetitions, and transmissions. Things are little better in the field of
            health. Suddenly, in the midst of such conditions, comes
            banishment, often like a bolt from the blue: You are red, white, black,
            a Russian, a Jew, a German, a Korean, a Jesuit, a Freemason-in any
            case, much lower than a dog. We have even on occasion observed
            victims joining the chorus of those condemning them.</p>


        <p>It may be useful to those thus threatened, usually without their own
            recognition of their predicament, to outline their position. A
            strategy for their situation may emerge in this manner. In the
            example of the elections, we saw how cleverly disguised the traps
            are. First, however, let us_ eliminate certain remaining
            misconceptions attached to the expression “forest passage,’ which
            could limit its agenda by favoring a narrower set of goals.</p>


        <p>In the first place, the forest passage should not be understood as a
            form of anarchism directed against the machine world, although the
            temptation is strong, particularly when the effort simultaneously
            aims at reconnecting with myth. The mythical will undoubtedly
            come; it is already on its way. In reality, the mythical is always
            present, and at the given moment it rises like a treasure to the
            surface. But it will emerge from the movement, as a heterogeneous
            principle, only at its highest, supremely developed stage. In this
            sense the movement is only the mechanism, the cry of birth. There
            is no return to the mythical; rather, it is encountered again when
            time is shaken to its foundations, and in the presence of extreme
            danger. Neither is it a question of the grapevine or—it is rather the
            grapevine and the ship. The numbers of those wanting to abandon
            ship is growing, among them sharp minds and sound spirits. This
            would amount to jumping off in mid-ocean. Then hunger, cannibalism,
            and the sharks arrive—in short, all the terrors of the raft of the
            Medusa. It is thus under all circumstances advisable to stay on board
            and on deck, even at the risk of being blown up with everything else.</p>


        <p>This objection is not directed at the poet, who, in his works and in
            his life, manifests the vast superiority of the world of the muses over
            the technical world. He helps people find the way back to
            themselves—the poet is a forest rebel.</p>


        <p>No less dangerous would be to limit the word to the German
            struggle for freedom. The catastrophe has precipitated Germany
            into a position that makes a military reorganization indispensable.
            Such a reform has not happened since the defeat of 1806: the armies,
            although dramatically changed, in scale as well as in tactics and
            technology, are still premised, like all our political establishments, on
            the basic ideas of the French Revolution. A true reorganization of the
            military would also not consist in adapting the army to aerial or
            nuclear strategies. Instead, it regards a new idea of freedom gaining
            force and form, as happened in the revolutionary armies after 1789
            and in the Prussian army after 1806. In this respect, other
            deployments of military power than those drawing force from the
            principles of total mobilization undoubtedly remain possible today.
            These principles, however, are not subordinated to the interests of
            nations but are adoptable wherever freedom reawakens in man.
            From a technical perspective we have reached a state where only
            two powers are still fully autarkic—that is, in a position to sustain a
            political strategy involving an arsenal of weapons sufficiently large
            for objectives on a planetary scale. A forest passage, on the other
            hand, is possible everywhere on the planet.</p>


        <p>With this we also want to make clear that there are no veiled anti-
            eastern designs in this expression. The fear that circulates on our
            planet today is largely inspired by the east, and it is expressed in
            tremendous preparations, in material and intellectual spheres. As
            obvious as this may appear, it is not a basic motive but rather a
            consequence of the international situation. The Russians are in the
            same straits as everyone else; indeed, if fear is the measure, they are
            possibly still more strongly in its grip. But fear cannot be diminished
            by armaments, only by gaining a new access to freedom. In this
            respect, Russians and Germans still have plenty to share with each
            other, for they share the same experiences. For Russians, too, the
            forest passage is the central issue. As a Bolshevik, he finds himself on
            the ship; as a Russian, he is in the forest. This relation both
            endangers him and assures his security.</p>


        <p>However, our intention is not at all to occupy ourselves with the
            foreground technicalities of the politics and its groupings. They
            sweep by while the threat remains, indeed returns more quickly and
            aggressively with every moment. The opponents come so to
            resemble each other that they are easily recognized as masks of one
            and the same power. It is not a question of prevailing over the
            phenomenon here or there, but rather of getting time itself under
            control. This requires sovereignty—and this will be found less in the
            great resolutions than in the individual who has renounced his inner
            fear. In the end, all the enormous preparations, which are directed
            solely at him, can only bring his triumph. This knowledge liberates
            him. The dictatorships then sink into the dust. These are the
            scarcely explored reserves of our times, and not only of ours. This
            freedom constitutes the theme of history in general, and it marks off
            its boundaries: on one side against the demonic realms, on the other
            against the merely zoological event. This is prefigured in myth and
            in religions, and it always returns; so, too, the giants and the titans
            always manifest with the same apparent superiority. The free man
            brings them down; and he need not always be a prince or a Hercules.
            A stone from a shepherd’s sling, a flag raised by a virgin, and a
            crossbow have already proven sufficient.</p>

        <p>Another question arises in this connection. To what extent is
            freedom desirable, even meaningful, in the context of our particular
            historical situation? Does an exceptional and easily undervalued
            merit of contemporary man not perhaps lie precisely in his capacity
            to surrender large portions of his freedom? In many respects he
            resembles a soldier on the march to unknown destinations, or a
            worker constructing a palace that others will inhabit—and this is
            certainly not among his worst traits. Should he then be redirected
            while the movement is still in progress?</p>


        <p>Anyone seeking to extract elements of meaning from events bound
            up with so much suffering only makes himself a stumbling block for
            others. That said, all prognoses that are based simply on a doom and
            gloom scenario miss the point. It is rather the case that we find
            ourselves trav-ersing a series of increasingly defined images,
            increasingly distinct impressions. Catastrophes barely interrupt the
            development, indeed they abbreviate it in many aspects. There can
            be no doubt that the whole thing has its objectives. Millions live
            under the spell of this prospect, lead lives that would be intolerable
            without it and inexplicable by pure coercion alone. The sacrifices
            may be compensated late, but they will not have been in vain.</p>


        <p>We touch here on the element of necessity, of destiny, which
            determines the gestalt of the Worker. There can be no birth without
            pain. The processes will continue, and, as in all fateful situations,
            attempts to arrest and return them to their points of departure can
            only foster and accelerate them.</p>


        <p>To avoid losing the way among mirages, it is therefore a good idea to
            always keep the necessary in mind. Yet the necessary is given us
            with its freedom, and a new order can only constitute itself once
            these two establish a new relation with each other. In a temporal
            perspective, all changes in the necessary bring with them changes in
            freedom. This is why the concepts of freedom of 1789 have become
            untenable and ineffective in controlling the violence. Freedom itself,
            on the other hand, is immortal, though always dressed in the
            garments of the times. Moreover, it must be earned each time anew.
            Inherited freedom must be reasserted in the forms that the
            encounter with historical necessity impresses on it.</p>


        <p>Admittedly, asserting one’s freedom today has become especially
            difficult. Resistance demands great sacrifice, which explains why the
            majority prefer to accept the coercion. Yet genuine history can only
            be made by the free; history is the stamp that the free person gives
            to destiny. In this sense, he can naturally act in a representative
            manner; his sacrifice will count for the others too.</p>


        <p>Let us assume that we have investigated the contours of the hemi-
            sphere in which the necessary is consummated. On this end, the
            technical, the typical, and the collective aspects stand out, at times
            grandiose, at others terrifying. Now we approach the other pole,
            where the individual presents himself, not only as sufferer but also
            as knower and judge.</p>


        <p>Here the contours change; they become freer and more spiritual,
            but the dangers also become more apparent.</p>


        <p>Nevertheless, it would have been impossible to start with this part of
            the task, since the necessary is given first. It may come our way as
            coercion, as sickness, as chaos, even as death—in any event, it must
            be understood as a test.</p>


        <p>Things cannot, therefore, come down to a question of modifying the
            blueprint of the work world; if anything, the great destruction lays
            the plans bare. That said, other edifices could certainly be erected
            than the termite mounds that the utopias partly foster, partly dread;
            the project is not as simplistic as all that. Neither is it a question of
            refusing to pay the times the toll they demand: duty and freedom
            can be reconciled.</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="19">19</section>

        <p>Here is another objection to consider: Should we count on
            catastrophe? Should we-if only intellectually-seek out the most
            distant waters, the cataracts, the maelstroms, the great abysses?</p>


        <p>The objection should not be underestimated. There is much to be
            said for staking out the safe routes that reason suggests, and
            sticking to them with all our will. This dilemma also has practical
            aspects, for example concerning armaments. Armaments exist for
            the eventuality of war, in the first place as a means of security. But
            then they lead to a threshold beyond which they themselves push on
            toward war, even appear to attract it. A level of investment occurs
            here that can only lead to bankruptcy. Picture a system of lightning
            conductors that eventually even brings on the thunderstorms.</p>


        <p>The same holds true in the intellectual domain. By fixating our
            imagination on the most extreme routes, we overlook the road in
            front of us. However, here too, the one need not exclude the other.
            Rather, reason demands that we ponder the possibilities in their
            totality and prepare a response for each of them, like a series of
            chess moves.</p>


        <p>In our present situation we are obliged to reckon with catastrophe,
            even take the possibility to bed with us, so that it does not surprise
            us in the middle of the night. Only in this manner can we
            accumulate a reserve of security that will make well-reasoned action
            possible. In a state of perfect security, the mind only plays with the
            idea of catastrophe; it integrates it as an unlikely power in its plans
            and covers the risk with a modest insurance. In our times things are
            the opposite. We must direct practically all our capital to the
            catastrophe-in order to merely keep a middle way open, a way that
            has in any case become as narrow as a razor’s edge.</p>


        <p>Knowledge of the middle way put forward by reason is
            indispensable; it is like a compass needle that reveals every
            movement, including any deviation. Only thus can we arrive at
            norms that all will recognize, without coercion. In this manner the
            legal boundaries will also be respected; in the long run, this way
            leads to victory.</p>


        <p>That a legal path can exist which all basically recognize—of this there
            can be no doubt. We are plainly moving away from the national
            states, away from the large partitions, toward planetary orders.
            These can be achieved by covenants and conventions, assuming only
            the good will of the partners. Above all, this would have to be
            demonstrated by an easing of sovereignty demands-—for there is
            fertility concealed in renunciation. Ideas and also facts exist upon
            which a mighty peace could be established. But this presupposes
            that borders be respected: annexations of provinces, resettlements
            of populations, the creation of corridors and divisions along lines of
            latitude—-these only perpetuate the violence. In this sense it is even
            advantageous that peace has not yet been achieved, and that the
            iniquity has not thereby gained official sanction.</p>


        <p>The peace of Versailles already contained the seeds of the Second
            World War. Based as it was on open force, it provided the gospel
            upon which each future act of violence was based. A second peace of
            this nature would have an even shorter life and destroy Europe.</p>


        <p>Let us move on, since we are interested in other than political ideas
            here. Our concern is far more the imperilment of the individual and
            his fear. He is preoccupied with the same conflict. Fundamentally, he
            is motivated by the desire to devote himself to family and career, to
            follow his natural inclinations; but then the times assert themselves
            —be it in a gradual deterioration of conditions, or that he suddenly
            senses an attack from extremist positions. Expropriations, forced
            labor, and worse appear in his vicinity. It quickly becomes clear to
            him that neutrality would be tantamount to suicide—now it is a case
            of joining the wolf pack or going to war against it.</p>


        <p>Caught in such straits, where is he to find a third element that will
            not simply go under in the movement? This can only be in his quality
            of being an individual, in his human Being, which remains unshaken.
            In such conditions it should be considered a great merit if
            knowledge of the virtuous way is not entirely lost. Anyone who has
            escaped the clutches of catastrophe knows that he basically had the
            help of simple people to thank, people who were not overcome by
            the hate, the terror, the mechanicalness of platitudes. These people
            withstood the propaganda and its plainly demonic insinuations.
            When such virtues also manifest in a leader of people, endless
            blessings can result, as with Augustus for example. This is the stuff
            of empires. The ruler reigns not by taking but by giving life. And
            therein lies one of the great hopes: that one perfect human being
            will step forth from among the millions.</p>


        <p>So much for the theory of catastrophes. We are not at liberty to
            avoid them, yet there is freedom in them. They are one of our trials.</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="20">20</section>

        <p>The teaching of the forest is as ancient as human history, and even
            older. Traces can already be found in the venerable old documents
            that we are only now partly learning to decipher. It constitutes the
            great theme of fairy tales, of sagas, of the sacred texts and
            mysteries. If we assign the fairy tale to the stone age, myth to the
            bronze age, and history to the iron age, we will stumble everywhere
            across this teaching, assuming our eyes are open to it. We will
            rediscover it in our own uranian epoch, which we might also call the
            age of radiation.</p>


        <p>The knowledge that primal centers of power are hidden in the
            mutating landscapes, founts of superabundance and cosmic power
            within the ephemeral phenomena, may be found always and
            everywhere. This knowledge comprises not only the symbolic
            sacramental foundation of the churches, its threads weave not only
            through esoteric doctrines and sects, but it also constitutes the
            nucleus of philosophical systems, however divergent these
            conceptual worlds may be. Fundamentally, all aim at this same
            mystery, a mystery that lies open to anyone who has once been
            initiated into it—be it conceived as idea, as original monad, as thing-
            in-itself, or, in our own day, as existence. Anyone who has once
            touched being has crossed the threshold where words, ideas,
            schools, and confessions still matter. Yet, in the process, he has also
            learned to revere that which is the life force of all of them.</p>


        <p>In this sense the word “forest” is also not the point. Naturally, it is no
            coincidence that all our bonds to timely cares so marvelously melt
            away the moment our glance falls on flowers and trees and is drawn
            into their spell. Here would be the right line of approach for a
            Spiritual elevation of botany. For here we find the Garden of Eden,
            the vineyard, the lily, the grain of wheat of Christian parable. We find
            the enchanted forest of fairy tales with its man-eating wolves, its
            witches and giants; but also the good hunter, and the sleeping
            beauty of the rose hedges in whose shadow time stands still. Here,
            too, are the forests of the Germans and Celts, like the Glasur woods
            in which the heroes defeat death—and, again, Gethsemane and its
            olive groves.</p>


        <p>But the same thing is also sought in other places—in caves, in
            labyrinths, in the desert where the tempter lives. To those who can
            divine its symbols a tremendous life force inhabits all things and
            places. Moses strikes his staff on the rock and the water of life
            spurts forth. A moment like this then suffices for millenia.</p>


        <p>All this only seems to have been given to remote places and times. In
            reality, it is concealed in every individual, entrusted to him in code,
            so that he might understand himself, in his deepest, supra-individual
            power.</p>


        <p>This is the goal of every teaching that is worthy of the name. Let
            matter condense into veritable walls that seem to block all
            prospects: yet the abundance is closest at hand, for it lives within
            man as a gift, as a time-transcending patrimony. It is up to him how
            he will grasp the staff: to merely support him on his life path, or to
            serve him as a scepter.</p>


        <p>Time provides us with new parables. We have unlocked forms of
            energy vastly more powerful than any previously known; yet this
            remains but a parable, for the formulas that human science
            discovers over time always lead back to that which has already long
            been known. The new lights, the new suns are passing flares that
            detach from the spirit. They verify the absolute in man, the
            miraculous power that is in him. And time and again it is the same
            strokes of fate that return to challenge him—not as this man or that,
            but as man per se.</p>


        <p>This great theme also carries through music: the changing figures
            lead the drama to the point where man encounters himself in his
            time-transcending dimensions, where he himself becomes an
            instrument of destiny. This is the supreme, most awesome
            invocation, to which only the master is entitled who knows how to
            guide us through the gates of judgment to salvation.</p>


        <p>Man has immersed himself too deeply in the constructions, he has
            devalued himself and lost contact with the ground. This brings him
            close to catastrophe, to great danger, and to pain. They drive him
            into untried territory, lead him toward destruction. How strange
            that it is just there—ostracized, condemned, fleeing-that he
            encounters himself anew, in his undivided and indestructible
            substance. With this he passes through the mirror images and
            recognizes himself in all his might.</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="21">21</section>

        <p>The forest is heimlich, secret. This is one of those words in the
            German language that simultaneously contains its opposite. The
            secret is the intimate, the well-protected home, the place of safety.
            But it is no less the clandestine, and in this sense it approaches the
            unheimlich, that which is uncanny or eerie. Whenever we stumble
            across roots like this, we may be sure that the great contradictions
            sound in them-—and the even greater equivalences—of life and death,
            whose solution was the concern of the mysteries.</p>


        <p>In this light the forest is the great house of death, the seat of
            annihilating danger. It is the task of the spiritual guide to lead his
            charge there by the hand, that he may lose his fear. He lets him die
            symbolically, and resurrect. A step before annihilation awaits
            triumph. The initiate who learns this is elevated beyond the powers
            of time. He learns that they can fundamentally do him no harm,
            indeed that they only exist to confirm his highest possibilities. The
            terrifying arsenal, set to devour him, is gathered around him. The
            picture is not new. The “new” worlds are always only copies of one
            and the same world. The gnostics, the desert hermits, the fathers,
            and the true theologians have known this world since the beginning.
            They knew the word that would fell the apparitions. The serpent of
            death was transformed into the staff, into the scepter of the initiate
            who seized it.</p>


        <p>Fear always takes on the mask, the style of the times. The gloomy
            vault of outer space, the visions of hermits, the spawn of Bosch and
            Cra-nach, the covens of witches and demons of the Middle Ages—all
            are links in the eternal chain of fear that shackles man, like
            Prometheus to the Caucasus. From whichever heavenly pantheon
            man may free himself, yet fear will stick, cunningly, at his side.
            And it will always appear to him as supreme, paralyzing reality. A man may
            join the realms of rigorous knowledge and ridicule earlier spirits
            who were so terrified by Gothic schemas and infernal imagery.</p>


        <p>Yet he will hardly suspect that he is caught in the same chains. The
            phantoms that test him will naturally conform to the style of
            knowledge, will appear as scientific facts. The old forest may have
            become a managed woodland, an economic factor; yet a lost child
            still strays in it. Now the world is a battlefield for armies of
            microbes;the apocalypse threatens as it always did, only now as the doings of
            physics. The old delusions continue to flourish in psychoses and
            neuroses. Even the man-eating ogre can be recognized again
            through his transparent cloak—and not only as exploiter and
            taskmaster in the bone mills of our times. More likely he will appear
            as a serologist, sitting among his instruments and retorts and
            pondering how to use human spleen or breastbone to produce
            marvelous new medicines. We are back in the heart of Dahomey, in
            old Mexico.</p>


        <p>This is all no less fictitious than the edifice of any other symbol
            world whose ruins we excavate from a pile of rubble. Like them, it
            too will pass away, crumble, and become incomprehensible to alien
            eyes. Then other fictions will rise from the inexhaustible womb of
            being, just as convincing, just as diverse and as flawlessly complete.</p>


        <p>It is advantageous that in our present condition we are at least not
            wasting away in complete torpor. For we ascend not only to great
            heights of self-awareness, but also to severe self-criticism. This a
            sign of high cultures, which raise their vaults above the dream
            world. Through our particular style, that of knowledge, we achieve
            insights analogous to the Indian image of the veil of Maya, or to
            Zarathustra’s teaching of the eternal recurrence of the same. Indian
            wisdom assigns even the rise and fall of divine realms to the world of
            illusion, to the foam of time. In this regard we cannot agree with
            Zimmer’s view that a similar greatness of vision is absent in our
            times. It is merely that we grasp it in the style of knowledge, which
            passes everything through the pulverizing mill of epistemology. Here
            shimmer the very limits of time and space. The same process,
            perhaps still more condensed and farther reaching, is repeating
            today in the turn from knowledge to being. In addition, there is the
            triumph of cyclic conceptions in the philosophy of history. Of
            course, this must be complemented by a knowledge of historia in
            nuce: that it is always the same theme, which is modified in endless
            variations of time and space. In this sense there exists not only a
            history of cultures but also of humanity, which, in its substance, in
            nuce, is a history of man. It recurs in the course of each human life.</p>


        <p>With this we have returned to our theme. At all times, in all places,
            and in every heart, human fear is the same: it is the fear of
            destruction, the fear of death. We can already hear it in Gilgamesh,
            we hear it in Psalm 90, and to this day nothing has changed.</p>


        <p>To overcome the fear of death is at once to overcome every other
            terror, for they all have meaning only in relation to this fundamental
            problem. The forest passage is, therefore, above all a passage
            through death.</p>


        <p>The path leads to the brink of death itself—indeed, if necessary, it
            passes through it. When the line is successfully crossed, the forest
            as a place of life is revealed in all its preternatural fullness. The
            superabundance of the world lies before us.</p>


        <p>Every authentic spiritual guidance is related to this truth—it knows
            how to bring man to the point where he recognizes the reality. This
            is most evident where the teaching and the example are united:
            when the conqueror of fear enters the kingdom of death, as we see
            Christ, the highest benefactor, doing. With its death, the grain of
            wheat brought forth not a thousand fruits, but fruits without
            number. The superabundance of the world was touched, which
            every generative act is related to as a symbol of time, and of time’s
            defeat. In its train followed not only the martyrs, who were stronger
            than the stoics, stronger than the caesars, stronger than the
            hundred thousand spectators surrounding them in the arena-there
            also followed the innumerable others who died with their faith
            intact. To this day this is a far more compelling force than it at first
            seems. Even when the cathedrals crumble, a patrimony of
            knowledge remains that undermines the palaces of the oppressors
            like catacombs. Already on these grounds we may be sure that the
            pure use of force, exercised in the old manner, cannot prevail in the
            long term. With this blood, substance was infused into history, and it
            is with good reason that we still number our years from this epochal
            turning point. The full fertility of theogony reigns here, the mythical
            generative power. The sacrifice is replayed on countless altars.</p>


        <p>In his poems Holderlin saw Christ as the exaltation of Herculean and
            Dionysian power. Hercules is the original prince, on whom even the
            gods depend in their battle with the titans. He dries out the swamps
            and builds canals, and, by defeating the fiends and monsters, he
            makes the wastelands habitable. He is first among the heroes, on
            whose graves the polis is founded, and by whose veneration it is
            preserved. Every nation has its Hercules, and even today graves form
            the central points from which the state receives its sacred luster.</p>


        <p>Dionysus is the master of ceremonies, the leader of the festive
            procession. When Holderlin refers to him as the spirit of community,
            this community is to be understand as including the dead, indeed
            especially them. Theirs is the glow that envelopes the Dionysian
            celebration, the deepest fount of cheerfulness. The doors of the
            kingdom of death are thrown wide open, and golden abundance
            streams forth. This is the meaning of the grapevine, in which the
            powers of earth and sun are united, of the masks, of the great
            transformation and recurrence.</p>


        <p>Among men we remember Socrates, who provided a fruitful example
            not only for the Stoics but for intrepid spirits of all times. We may
            hold different views on the life and teachings of this man; his death,
            in any case, was among the greatest events. The world is so
            constituted that its passions and prejudices always demand a tribute
            in blood, and we should know that this will never be otherwise. The
            arguments may change, but ignorance will eternally hold court. Man
            is charged for being contemp-tuous of the gods, then for not
            bending to a dogma, and later again for having repudiated a theory.
            There exists no great word and no noble thought for which blood
            has not flowed. It is Socratic to understand that the judgment is
            invalid—to understand this in a more elevated sense than any merely
            human for-and-against can establish. The true judgment is spoken
            from the beginning; its purpose is to exalt the sacrifice. Therefore, if
            modern Greeks were ever to seek an appeal of this sentence, it
            would only be one more useless gloss on world history—particularly
            in a period in which the innocent blood flows in rivers. This trial is
            never-ending, and we met the philistines sitting as its judges on
            every street corner today, in every parliament. That this could only
            change: since the earliest times, this thought has always
            distinguished superficial minds. Human greatness must ever and
            again be won anew. Victory comes when the assault of the ignoble is
            beaten back in one’s own breast. Here is the authentic substance of
            history: in man’s encounter with himself, that is, with his own divine
            power. Anyone aspiring to teach history should know this. Socrates
            called this most profound place, from which a voice advised and
            directed him—no longer even with words—his Daimonion. We could
            also call it the forest.</p>


        <p>What would it now mean for a contemporary man to take his lead
            from the example of death’s champion, of these gods, heroes, and
            sages? It would mean that he join the resistance against the times,
            and not merely against these times, but against all times, whose
            basic power is fear. Every fear, however distantly derived it may
            seem, is at its core the fear of death. If a man succeeds in creating
            breathing room here, he will gain freedom also in other spheres that
            are ruled by fear. Then he will fell the giants whose weapons are
            terror. This, too, has recurred again and again in history.</p>


        <p>It is in the nature of things that education today aims at precisely
            the opposite of this. Never have such strange ideas prevailed in the
            teaching of history as today. The intention in all systems is to inhibit
            any metaphysical influx, to tame and train in the interests of the
            collective. Even in circumstances where the Leviathan finds itself
            dependent on courage, on the battlefield for instance, it will seek to
            simulate a second, even more ominous threat to keep the fighter at
            his post. Such states depend on their police.</p>


        <p>The great solitude of the individual is a hallmark of our times. He is
            surrounded, encircled by fear, which pushes walls in against him on
            all sides. This takes on concrete forms—in prisons, in slavery, in
            battles of encirclement. The thoughts, the soliloquies, perhaps even
            the diaries from the years when even the neighbors could not be
            trusted, are filled with this material.</p>


        <p>Politics drives into other zones here—be it natural history, or
            demonic history with all its horrors. At the same time powerful
            forces of salvation are sensed close at hand. The terrors are wake-up
            calls; they are signs of quite other dangers than those projected by
            the historical conflicts. They amount to increasingly urgent
            questions posed to man. Nobody can answer for him but himself.</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="22">22</section>

        <p>At this threshold man is initiated into his theological trial, whether
            he realizes it or not. Again, we should not put inordinate weight on
            the word. Man is interrogated about his supreme values, about his
            view of the world as a whole and the relationship of his existence to
            it. This need not happen in words, indeed it eludes the word. It is
            also not about the particular formulation of the answer; that is, it is
            not a question of this confession or that.</p>

        <p>We can thus leave aside the churches. There are significant
            indications today—indeed, especially today—that attest to the
            unexhausted good contained in them. Above all there is the attitude
            of their opponents, in the first place that of the state, which aspires
            to absolute power. This necessarily leads to persecution of the
            churches. In the new state of affairs man is to be handled as a
            zoological being, regardless of whether the theories predominating
            at the time categorize him along economic or other lines. This leads
            at first into zones of pure utility, thereafter to bes-tial exploitation.</p>


        <p>On the other hand there is the institutional character of the church,
            as a man-made organization. In this regard there is the constant
            threat of rigidification and the consequent drying up of its
            beneficent forces. This explains the gloomy, mechanical, and
            nonsensical aspects of many church services, the recurring Sunday
            torment, and of course sectarian-ism. The institutional element is at
            the same time the vulnerable aspect; weakened by doubt, the edifice
            crumbles overnight—if it has not simply been transformed into a
            museum. We need to reckon with times and regions where the
            church simply no longer exists. The state will then see itself called
            upon to fill the gap that has resulted, or been revealed, with its own
            means—an enterprise in which it can only fail.</p>


        <p>For those who are not to be so crudely fobbed off, the prospect of a
            forest passage presents itself. The priestly type, someone who
            believes that a higher life is impossible without sacrament and sees
            his calling in satisfying this hunger, may find himself forced into
            such a passage. It leads into the forest, to a form of existence that
            always recurs after persecutions and that has often been described:
            in the story of the holy Polycarp, for example; or in the memoirs of
            the excellent d’Aubigne, Henry IV’s Master of the Horse. In more
            modern times, we could name Graham Greene and his novel The Power and the Glory,
            with its tropical setting. Naturally, the forest in this sense is everywhere;
            it can even be in a metropolitan neighborhood.</p>


        <p>Beyond that it will also be a necessity for any individuals who
            cannot resign themselves to mere functions in the zoological-political
            arrangement. With this we touch on the essence of modern
            suffering, the great emptiness that Nietzsche characterized as the
            growth of the deserts. The deserts grow: this is the spectacle of
            civilization with its vacuous relationships. In this landscape the
            question of provisions becomes especially urgent, especially
            haunting: “The desert grows, woe to him in whom deserts hide."</p>


        <p>It is a good thing if churches can create oases—but a better thing
            still if man does not content himself with that. The church can provide
            assistance but not existence. Here, too, from an_ institutional
            perspective, we are still on the ship, still in motion; peace lies
            in the forest. The decision takes place in man, and none can take it off his hands.</p>


        <p>The desert grows: the fallow and barren circles expand. First the
            meaningfully arranged quarters disappear: the gardens whose fruits
            we innocently fed on, the rooms equipped with well-proven
            instruments.</p>


        <p>Then the laws become questionable, the apparatuses double-edged.
            Woe to him in whom deserts hide: woe to him who carries within
            not one cell of that primal substance that ensures fertility, again
            and again.</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="23">23</section>

        <p>There are two touch- and milestones that no one today can
            avoid—they are doubt and pain, the two great instruments of
            the nihilistic reduction. One has to have passed by them. This is the
            challenge, the matriculation test for a new age, and none will be spared
            it. For this reason things have advanced incomparably further in some
            countries of our planet than in others, perhaps precisely in
            those countries we consider undeveloped.
            This would belong in a chapter on optical illusions.</p>


        <p>What is the terrible question that the void poses to man? It is
            the ancient riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus. Man is interrogated
            about himself—does he know the name of the curious being that moves
            through time? Depending on his answer, he will be devoured or
            crowned. The void wants to know if man is equal to it, whether
            there are elements in him that no time can destroy. In this sense, the
            void and time are identical; and so it is understandable that with the
            great power of the void time becomes very valuable, even in its
            tiniest fractions. At the same time, the apparatuses continue to
            multiply—that is, the arsenal of time. This results in the error
            that it is the apparatuses, in particular machine technology, that
            render the world void. The opposite is true: the apparatuses grow
            relentlessly and draw ever closer because an answer is again due to the
            age-old question to man. The apparatuses are witnesses that time needs
            to demonstrate to the senses its superiority. If man answers
            correctly, the apparatuses lose their magical gleam and submit themselves
            to his hand. It is important to realize this.</p>


        <p>We have touched here on the fundamental issue: time’s question
            to man about his power. It is directed at his substance. All that
            may emerge in the form of hostile empires, weapons, and hardships
            belongs only to the mise-en-scéne by which the drama is staged.
            There can be no doubt that man will once again conquer time,
            will banish the void back into its hole.</p>


        <p>A sign of this interrogation is loneliness, something
            remarkable in times with such a flourishing cult of community. Yet few will be
            spared the experience that it is precisely the collective that
            takes on an inhumane aspect today. And there is a second, similar
            paradox: that the freedom of the individual is increasingly restricted in
            direct correspondence to the tremendous conquest of space in general.</p>


        <p>With this observation on loneliness we might end the chapter
            here—for what use can there be in bringing up situations to which
            neither helpful means nor spiritual guides can get through? There is a
            tacit agreement that this is our situation, as there are also things
            that we only reluctantly discuss. A positive trait of contemporary man
            is his reserved attitude toward lofty platitudes, his objective need
            for intellectual honesty. There is additionally the particular
            quality of his consciousness that can discern even the subtlest false note. At
            least in this respect people still have a sense of shame.</p>


        <p>Nonetheless, this is a forum where significant things are taking
            place. Someday, perhaps, those parts of our literature that
            sprung from the least literary intentions may be perceived as its most
            powerful voices: all the narratives, letters, and diaries that
            came into existence in the great witch hunts, in the encirclements, and in
            the flaying huts of our world. It will be recognized then that man
            had reached a depth in his de profundis that touched the bedrock of
            being and broke the tyrannical power of doubt. In that moment,
            he lost his fear.</p>


        <p>The manner in which such an attitude forms, even when it
            ultimately fails, can be followed in the notes of Petter Moen,
            discovered in the air shaft of his prison cell. Moen, a
            Norwegian who died in German imprisonment, can be considered a spiritual
            successor of Kierkegaard. In almost all cases when such letters
            are preserved, also those of Graf Moltke for instance, a fortunate
            coincidence is involved. Cracks like these provide insights into
            a world believed to have died out. We should still see documents
            from Bolshevik Russia joining these, to complement and add previously
            unknown meaning to what we thought to have observed there.</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="24">24</section>

        <p>Another question is this: how is man to be prepared for
            paths that lead into darkness and the unknown? The fulfillment of this
            task belongs chiefly to the churches, and in many known, and many
            more unknown, cases, it has effectively been accomplished. It has
            been confirmed that greater force can be preserved in churches
            and sects than in what are today called worldviews—which usually means
            natural science raised to the level of philosophical
            conviction. It is for this reason that we see tyrannical regimes so rabidly
            persecuting such harmless creatures as the Jehovah’s Witnesses—the same
            tyrannies that reserve seats of honor for their nuclear
            physicists.</p>


        <p>It shows a healthy instinct that today’s youth is beginning
            to show new interest in religion. Even if the churches should prove
            themselves unable to cater to this instinct, the initiative
            is important because it creates a framework for comparisons. It reveals
            what was possible in the past, and hence what one may be justified in
            expecting from the future. What was possible is still
            recognizable today in only a single limited field, that of art history.
            Yet the futurists were at least right about one thing: that all the
            paintings, palaces, and museum cities mean nothing in comparison with
            the primal creative force. The mighty current that left all
            these creations in its wake like colorful seashells can never run dry—it
            continues to flow deep underground. If man looks into himself, he will
            rediscover it. And with that he will create points in the desert where
            oases become possible.</p>


        <p>Yet we do need to reckon with broad regions in which
            churches either no longer exist or have themselves withered into
            organs of the tyranny. Still more important is the consideration that
            in many people today a strong need for religious ritual coexists
            with an aversion to churches. There is a sense of something missing
            in existence, which explains all the activity around gnostics,
            founders of sects, and evangelists, who all, more or less
            successfully, step into the role of the churches. One might say that a certain
            definite quantity of religious faith always exists, which in previous
            times was legitimately satisfied by the churches. Now, freed up, it
            attaches itself to all and everything. This is the gullibility of
            modern man, which coexists with a lack of faith. He believes what he
            reads in the newspaper but not what is written in the stars.</p>


        <p>The gap created here is perceptible even in fully
            secularized existence, and there is consequently no lack of attempts to
            close it with available means. A book like Bry’s Disguised Religion
            provides insight into this world in which science departs from its
            proper field and gains conventicle founding power. Often it is even the
            same individual in whom the science waxes and then wanes, as can
            be followed for instance in the careers of Haeckel or Driesch.</p>


        <p>Since the loss makes itself felt above all as suffering, it
            should not be Surprising that doctors in particular apply themselves to
            the problem, with subtle systems for sounding the depths and
            therapies based on these. Among the most common category of patients
            that they seek to help are those who want to kill their fathers.
            Another type-those who have lost their fathers and suffer from an
            unawareness of their loss—will be sought in vain among their
            patients. This futility is with good reason, for medicine is
            impotent at this point. Certainly, there must be something of a
            priest in every good doctor; but the thought of taking over for the priest
            can only occur to doctors in times when the distinction between
            salvation and health has been lost. Therefore, we may think what we
            want about the various imitations of such spiritual instruments
            and forms as examinations of conscience, confession, meditation,
            prayer, ecstasy, and others—none of the imitations reach deeper than
            the symptoms, if they are not actually harmful.</p>


        <p>Attempts to refer back to higher worlds to which access has
            disappeared can only increase the inner erosion. A depiction
            of the suffering, a diagnosis, is more important—a precise
            circumscription of what has been lost. Curiously, this is more easily found
            in a convincing form in writers than in theologians, from
            Kierkegaard to Bernanos. As we said earlier, a balance remains open to this day only
            in art history. Now it is also necessary to make a balance
            visible for the human power of the individual. But we should not look to
            the field of ethics to fulfill this task, for it really lies in
            that of existence. A person scraping by, if not in an actual wasteland then in
            a wasted zone such as an industrial city, to whom a mere glimmer, a
            brief whiff of the immense power of being is imparted—such a
            person begins to sense that something is missing in his life. This
            is the prerequisite for him to start searching. Now it is important
            that it is a theologian who removes the scales from his eyes, because
            only in this way will this seeker have any prospect of reaching his
            goal. All other faculties, not to even mention the merely practical
            ones, would only send him off chasing mirages. Apparently, in the
            great syllabus of mankind there are a certain number of such
            pictures that must first be successfully passed—utopic passages,
            transfigured by the perspective of progress. Whether progress projects
            before man images of universal dominion, termite-like ideal states, or
            realms of eternal peace—where an authentic mandate is lacking, this
            will all prove illusionary. In this respect, the Germans have paid
            enormous dues for their apprentice-ship; yet, if they are able to
            sincerely grasp these as such, it will prove to be well-spent capital.</p>


        <p>Theologians of today must be prepared to deal with people as
            they are today—above all with people who do not live in sheltered
            reserves or other lower pressure zones. A man stands before
            them who has emptied his chalice of suffering and doubt, a man
            formed far more by nihilism than by the church—-ignoring for the
            moment how much nihilism is concealed in the church itself.
            Typically, this person will be little developed ethically or spiritually,
            however eloquent he may be in convincing platitudes. He will be
            alert, intelligent, active, skeptical, inartistic, a natural-born
            debaser of higher types and ideas, an insurance fanatic, someone set on
            his own advantage, and easily manipulated by the catchphrases of
            propaganda whose often abrupt turnabouts he will hardly
            perceive; he will gush with humanitarian theory, yet be equally
            inclined to awful violence beyond all legal limits or international law
            whenever a neighbor or fellow human being does not fit into his
            system. At the same time he will feel haunted by malevolent forces, which
            penetrate even into his dreams, have a low capacity to enjoy
            himself, and have forgotten the meaning of a real festival. On the
            other hand, it must be added that he enjoys the advantages of a peaceful
            age of technological comfort: that the average life expectancy has
            significantly risen; that the basic tenets of theoretical
            equality are universally recognized; and that, in some places at least,
            there are models to be studied of lifestyles that, in their comfort
            for all levels of society, their individual freedoms, and automatized
            perfection, have perhaps never existed before. It is not unthinkable
            that this lifestyle will spread after the titanic era of technology
            has run its course. Just the same, man is suffering a loss, and this
            loss explains the manifest grayness and hopelessness of his existence,
            which in some cities and even in whole lands so overshadows life that
            the last smiles have been extinguished and people seem trapped in
            Kafkaesque underworlds.</p>


        <p>Giving this man an inkling of what has been taken from him,
            even in the best possible present circumstances, and of what immense
            power still rests within him-this is the theological task. A
            true theologian is someone who understands the science of
            abundance, which transcends mere economy, and who knows the mystery of
            the eternal springs, which are inexhaustible and always at hand.
            By a theologian we mean someone who knows-—and a knower in this
            sense is the little prostitute Sonya, who discovers the
            treasure of being in Raskolnikov and knows how to raise it to the light
            for him. The reader senses that these gifts have been brought to the
            surface not for life alone but also for transcendence. This is the
            great aspect of this novel, indeed of all of Dostoyevsky’s work, which
            acts like a breakwater on which the errors of the times are pulverized.
            These are talents that emerge more clearly after every new
            catastrophe and in which the Russian pen has achieved world status.</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="25">25</section>

        <p>In the vicinity of the zero meridian, where we still linger, faith no longer has value; here it is evidence
            that
            is
            demanded. One could also say that at this point people have faith in evidence. A rising number of people
            seem to
            realize that the spiritual life, even seen from a technical perspective, has more effective forms at its
            disposal
            than military discipline, athletic training, or the routines of the work world. Ignatius knew this, and
            today
            this
            knowledge also sustains founders of sects and leaders of small circles whose intentions are difficult to
            judge—an
            example is Gurdjieff, from the Caucasus, a remarkable man in many ways.</p>

        <p>What instruments should be put in the hands of those who actively strive to leave the wasteland of
            rationalistic
            and
            materialistic systems but are still subject to their dialectic coercion? Their suffering heralds a higher
            existential state for them. There are methods to strengthen them in this direction, and it is unimportant if
            these
            are initially practiced mechanically. The process resembles resuscitation routines for the drowning, which
            must
            also
            first be practiced. Then breathing and a pulse return.</p>

        <p>Here the possibility of a new order presents itself. As the Counter reformation corresponded in its essence
            to
            the
            Reformation and was invigorated by it, so we might imagine a spiritual movement that seeks out the terrain
            of
            nihilism and places itself in opposition to it, as a mirror image in being. As a missionary speaks to the
            natives in
            their language, so it is advisable to proceed with those raised with scientific jargon. Certainly, it
            becomes
            evident here that the churches have not kept pace with science. At the same time, some individual sciences
            are
            advancing into zones where discussions about core issues become possible.</p>

        <p>In this respect a work entitled, say, A Small Catechism for Atheists would be desirable. Were a similar
            undertaking
            to be erected as an advance outpost by a vigorous spiritual power, it would simultaneously work against the
            numerous gnostic spirits who strive in this direction.</p>

        <p>Many differences are simply based on terminology. A spirited atheist always comes across more sympathetically
            than
            an
            indifferent man- of-the-crowd since he concerns himself with the world as a totality. Moreover, such a
            person is
            not
            infrequently open to higher possibilities-which is why the eighteenth-century atheists were truly powerful
            spirits,
            and more pleasant than those of the nineteenth century.</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="26">26</section>

        <p>“Here and now” is the forest rebel’s motto—he is the spirit of free and independent action. As we saw, only a
            small
            fraction of the mass populace can be counted among this type, and yet these few form a small elite able to
            resist
            the automatism, on whom the pure use of force must fail. This is the old freedom in the garments of the new
            times:
            the substantial, elemental freedom that awakens in healthy populations when the tyranny of parties or
            foreign
            occupiers oppresses the land. It is not a merely protesting or emigrating freedom, but one set on taking up
            the
            fight.</p>

        <p>This distinction has an influence on the realm of faith. The forest rebel cannot permit himself the kind of
            indifference that, like small state neutrality and fortress confinement for political crimes, characterized
            the
            past
            period. The forest passage leads to difficult decisions. The task of the forest rebel is to stake out
            vis-a-vis
            the
            Leviathan the measures of freedom that are to obtain in future ages. He will not get by this opponent with
            mere
            ideas.</p>

        <p>The resistance of the forest rebel is absolute: he knows no neutrality, no pardon, no fortress confinement.
            He
            does
            not expect the enemy to listen to arguments, let alone act chivalrously. He knows that the death penalty
            will
            not be
            waived for him. The forest rebel comes to learn a new solitude, the kind of solitude that above all the
            satanically
            growing malevolence brings with it; its connection with science and mechanics, though this may not represent
            a
            new
            element, does introduce new phenomena into history.</p>

        <p>There is no reconciling all this with indifference. In this state of affairs one also cannot afford to wait
            for
            the
            churches, or for Spiritual guides and books that might surface. Yet it does have the advantage of leading us
            beyond
            mere book knowledge, conditioned sentiments, and inherited beliefs, and onto firmer ground. This effect was
            already
            apparent in the difference between the two world wars, at least regarding German youth. After 1918, a strong
            spiritual current could be observed, which led to an unfolding of talents everywhere. Now it is above all
            the
            silence that
            is
            conspicuous, particularly the silence of the youth, despite the many extraordinary things they witnessed in
            the
            cauldrons and murderous imprisonments of their wartime experience. This silence weighs more than any
            development
            of
            ideas, more even than any works of art. They observed more than just the collapse of the national states.
            Though
            this contact with nothingness, even the naked, unadorned nothingness of our century, has been depicted in a
            row
            of
            clinical reports, we should expect it to bear still other fruits.</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="27">27</section>

        <p>We have repeatedly used the image of man’s meeting with himself. Indeed, it is important for anyone intending
            to
            undertake a risky venture that he first gain a precise idea of himself. In this the man onboard the ship
            must
            take
            his measure from the man in the forest— that is, the man of civilization, the man involved in the movements
            and
            historical phenomena must refer back to his latent supra- temporal essence, which incarnates into history
            and is
            transformed within it. A venture of this kind will appeal to strong spirits like the forest rebel. In this
            process,
            the mirror image contemplates the primal image, from which it emanates and in which it is inviolable— or,
            equivalently, the inherited being remembers that which underlies all inheritance.</p>

        <p>This is a solitary meeting, and therein lies its fascination; no notary, priest, or dignitary will be in
            attendance.
            In this solitude man is sovereign, assuming that he has recognized his true station. He is the Son of the
            Father,
            lord of the earth, the issue of a miraculous creation. In such encounters the social element also retreats
            into
            the
            background. As in the most ancient times, man reclaims the priestly and knightly powers for himself. He
            leaves
            behind the abstractions, the functions, and work divisions, and places himself in relation to the whole, to
            the
            absolute—and a profound happiness lies in this.</p>

        <p>Clearly, there will also be no doctors at this meeting. In regard to health, the primal image that each of us
            carries
            within is our invulnerable body, created beyond time and its perils, which radiates into its corporeal
            manifestation
            and is also a factor in its healing. Powers of creation have a role in every cure.</p>

        <p>In the now rare condition of perfect health, man is also aware of this higher form in whose aura he is
            visibly
            enclosed. In Homer we still encounter a familiarity with this freshness; it animates his world. We find it
            associated with a free and open cheerfulness, and the nearer the heroes draw to the gods, so do they gain
            invulnerability—their bodies become more spiritual.</p>

        <p>Today, too, the cure originates in the numinous, and it is important that man allows himself to be guided by
            it,
            at
            least intuitively. It is the patient—and not the doctor—who is sovereign, who provides the cure, which he
            dispenses
            from residences that are out of all harm’s reach. He is lost only if he loses access to these sources. In
            his
            death
            throes a man often resembles someone astray and in search of something; he will find the exit, whether in
            this
            world
            or another. People have been cured whom the doctors had written off, but none who gave themselves up for
            dead.
        </p>

        <p>Avoiding doctors, trusting the truth of the body, and keeping an ear open to its voice: this is the best
            formula
            for
            the healthy. This is equally valid for the forest rebel, who must be prepared for situations in which any
            sickness—aside from the deadly ones—would be a luxury. Whatever opinion one may hold of the world of health
            plans,
            insurance, pharma-ceutical firms, and specialists, the person who can dispense with all of this is the
            stronger
            for
            it.</p>

        <p>A dubious development to be wary of in the highest degree is the constantly increasing influence that the
            state
            is
            beginning to have on health services, usually under philanthropic pretexts. Moreover, given the widespread
            release
            of doctors from their doctor-patient confidential-ity obligations, a general mistrust is also advisable for
            consultations; it is impossible to know which statistics one will be included in—also beyond the health
            sector.
            All
            these healthcare enterprises, with poorly paid doctors on salaries, whose treatments are supervised by
            bureaucracies, should be regarded with suspicion; overnight they can undergo alarming transformations, and
            not
            just
            in the event of war. It is not inconceivable that the flawlessly maintained files will then furnish the
            documents
            needed to intern, castrate, or liquidate.</p>

        <p>The enormous popularity enjoyed by charlatans and miracle workers today is not only explained by the
            gullibility
            of
            the masses; it also reflects their mistrust of the medical industry and in particular of the manner in which
            it
            is becoming automated.
            However crudely they may ply their trade, these conjurors differ in two important aspects: first, in their
            treating
            the patient as a whole; and second, in portraying the cure as miraculous. It is precisely this that a still-
            healthy
            instinct seeks, and on which the cure is based.</p>

        <p>Needless to say, similar things are also possible in conventional medicine. Anyone who heals participates in
            a
            miracle, with, or even despite, his apparatuses and methods, and it is already a step forward if he
            recognizes
            this.
            Wherever a doctor with human substance appears on the scene, the mechanism can be broken, neutralized, or
            even
            made
            useful. Naturally, such direct care is hampered by bureaucracy. Yet, ultimately, it is also true that “on
            the
            ship,"
            or even in the galleys where we live, there will always be men who break through the pure functionality, be
            it
            through their kindness, their freedom, or their courage in taking direct responsibility. A doctor who does
            something
            for a patient against the regulations may, by just such initiative, lend miraculous power to his means. We
            are
            truly
            alive only insofar as we are able to emerge from mere functionality.</p>

        <p>The technician counts on single advantages. On a bigger balance sheet things often assume a different aspect.
            What
            are the real gains from the world of insurance, vaccinations, meticulous hygiene, and a high life
            expectancy? It
            is
            futile to argue the point, since this world will in any case continue to develop until the ideas on which it
            is
            based are exhausted. The ship will sail on, even beyond the catastrophes. Naturally, the catastrophes result
            in
            tremendous cullings. When a ship goes down, its dispensary sinks with it. Then other things become more
            important,
            such as the ability to survive a few hours in icy water. A regularly vaccinated and sanitized crew,
            habituated
            to
            medication and of high average age, has a lower chance of survival here than a crew that knows nothing of
            all
            this.
            A minimal mortality rate in quiet times is no measure of true health; overnight it can switch into its
            opposite.
            It
            is even possible that it may generate previously unknown contagions. The tissue of the people weakens,
            becomes
            more susceptible to attack.</p>

        <p>Here the prospect opens up on one of the greatest dangers of our times: overpopulation, as Bouthoul for
            instance
            depicted it in his book A Hundred Million Dead. Our public health infrastructure is faced with the challenge
            of
            containing the same masses whose arising it made possible. But this leads us away from the theme of the
            forest
            passage. For anyone contemplating a forest passage, hothouse air is no advantage.</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="28">28</section>

        <p>It is disquieting how concepts and things often change their aspects from one day to the next and produce
            quite
            other
            results than those expected. It is a sign of anarchy.</p>

        <p>Let us take, for example, the rights and freedoms of individuals in relation to authority. Though they are
            defined
            in
            the constitution, we will clearly have to reckon with continual and unfortunately also long-term violations
            of
            these
            rights, be it by the state, by a party that has taken control of the state, a foreign invader, or some
            combination
            of these. Moreover, the masses, at least in this country, are barely still able to perceive constitutional
            violations as such. Once this awareness is lost, it cannot be artificially recuperated.</p>

        <p>Violations of rights can also present a semblance of legality, for example when the ruling party achieves a
            majority
            sufficient to allow constitutional changes. The majority can simultaneously be in the right and do
            wrong-simpler
            minds may not grasp this contradiction. Even during voting it is often difficult to discern where the rights
            end
            and
            the force begins.</p>

        <p>The abuses can gradually intensify, eventually emerging as open crimes against certain groups. Anyone who has
            observed such acts being cheered on by the masses knows that little can be undertaken to oppose them with
            conventional means. An ethical suicide cannot be expected of everyone, especially not when the suggestion
            comes
            from
            abroad.</p>

        <p>In Germany, open resistance to the authorities is, or at least was, particularly difficult, because a certain
            reverence for the state had survived from the days of the legitimate monarchy; along with its dark sides,
            this
            had
            advantages. Consequently, it was difficult for the individual to understand why, with the arrival of the
            victorious
            forces, he was held liable for his lack of resistance, not only generally, as part of a guilty collective,
            but
            even
            personally—for instance, for continuing to practice his profession as a musical director or a civil servant.
        </p>

        <p>Whatever grotesque blooms this accusation may have brought forth, we should not treat it as a curiosity.
            Rather,
            it
            should be recognized as a new trait of our world, and we can only advise that it always be kept in mind in
            times
            of
            widespread public injustice. On the one hand one is suspected of collaborating with occupiers, on the other
            of
            being
            a party lackey. Situations thereby arise in which the individual is trapped between Scylla and Charybdis; he
            is
            threatened with liquidation through both involvement and non-involvement.</p>

        <p>Great courage is thus expected of the individual; he will be called on to lend an open hand to the law,
            alone, at
            his
            own risk, and even against the power of the state. One may doubt that such people can be found at all. But
            then
            they
            surface and are forest rebels. This human type will step onto the stage of history even against its own
            will,
            since
            there are forms of oppression that leave no alternative. Needless to say, a forest rebel must be fit for the
            task.
            Wilhelm Tell also got mixed up in a conflict against his will; but then he proved himself a forest rebel, an
            individual by whose example the people became aware of their own native power over the oppressor.</p>

        <p>It is an extraordinary image: one, or even many individuals making a stand against the Leviathan. Yet it is
            precisely
            here that vulnerable spots are revealed in the colossus’s armor. It must be recognized that even a tiny
            group of
            truly resolved individuals can be dangerous, not just morally but also effectively. In peaceful times this
            can
            only
            be observed in criminals. Incidents in which two or three desperadoes set a whole city quarter in turmoil
            and
            cause
            a long, drawn-out standoff are becoming more frequent. If the relationship is inverted by the authorities
            becoming
            the criminals, the defensive actions of law-abiding citizens can _ trigger incomparably more significant
            results.
            The shock Napoleon received from the conspiracy of Malet, a solitary but unrelenting individual, is well
            known.

        <p>Let us now imagine a city, or a state, in which some, perhaps only a few, truly free men still live. Under
            these
            circumstances, a breach of the constitution would be accompanied by high risks. This would support the
            theory of
            collective responsibility: the possibility of a violation of rights is directly proportional to the amount
            of
            freedom it comes up against. An assault on the inviolability, on the sacredness of the home, would have been
            impossible in old Iceland in the way it was carried out in 1933, among a million inhabitants of Berlin, as a
            purely
            administrative measure. A laudable exception deserves mention here, that of a young social democrat who shot
            down
            half a dozen so-called auxiliary policemen at the entrance of his apartment. He still partook of the
            substance
            of
            the old Germanic freedom, which his enemies only celebrated in theory. Naturally, he did not get this from
            his
            party’s manifesto—and he was certainly also not of the type Léon Bloy describes as running to their lawyer
            while
            their mother is being raped.</p>

        <p>If we assume that we could have counted on just one such person in every street of Berlin, then things would
            have
            turned out very differently than they did. Long periods of peace foster certain optical illusions: one is
            the
            conviction that the inviolability of the home is grounded in the constitution, which should guarantee it. In
            reality, it is grounded in the family father, who, sons at his side, fills the doorway with an axe in his
            hand.
            This
            truth, however, is not always visible and should also not be a pretext for objections to the constitution.
            The
            old
            saying holds that “The man is guarantor of his oath, not the oath of the man." This is one ground why new
            legislation meets with so little participation from the people. The apartment story has a healthy ring to
            it-only we
            live in times in which one official passes the buck to the other.</p>

        <p>The Germans have been reproached, perhaps justifiably, for not opposing the officially sanctioned violence
            with
            enough resistance. But they did not yet know the rules of the game, and also felt threatened from other
            quarters
            where there was no talk of inviolable rights, neither then nor now. The middle position is always subject
            to a double threat: it has the advantage, but also the disadvantage, of being both this and that. All the
            Germans
            who fell, unarmed and in desperate situations, defending their women and children are to this very day
            barely
            considered. Their solitary ends too will be known; their weight will also be thrown onto the balance.</p>

        <p>We, on the other hand, must take care that the spectacle of unopposed violence does not repeat.</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="29">29</section>

        <p>In the event of a foreign invasion, the forest passage presents itself as a possible military tactic. This is
            true
            above all for weakly or wholly unarmed states.</p>

        <p>As with the churches, so too with armaments the forest rebel does not need to know if or to what degree they
            have
            been perfected, nor even if they are present at all. These questions are relevant only on the ship. A forest
            passage
            can be realized anywhere, at any time, also against vastly superior forces. In the latter case, it will even
            be
            the
            only possibility of resistance.</p>

        <p>The forest rebel is no soldier. He does not know the military life and its discipline. His life is at once
            freer
            and
            harder than the soldierly one.</p>

        <p>Forest rebels are recruited from the ranks of those resolved to fight for freedom, even when the outlook is
            hopeless.
            In the ideal case, their personal freedom coincides with the liberation of their land. This is one of the
            great
            advantages of free peoples; the longer a war goes on, the greater its significance.</p>

        <p>Also dependent on the forest passage are those individuals for whom other forms of existence have become
            impossible.
            An invasion is followed by the imposition of measures that threaten large sections of the population:
            arrests;
            searches; registration in lists; forced labor; foreign military service. This drives people to resistance,
            secretly
            or even openly.</p>

        <p>In this regard a special danger lies in the infiltration of criminal elements. The forest rebel may not fight
            according to martial law, but neither does he fight like a bandit. Just as little can his form of discipline
            be
            called military; this presupposes strong, direct self- leadership.</p>

        <p>As far as location is concerned, the forest is everywhere-in the wastelands as much as in the cities, where a
            forest rebel may hide or live behind the mask of a profession. The forest is in the desert, and the forest
            is
            in the bush.The forest is in the fatherland, as in every territory in which resistance can be put into
            practice.
            But the forest is above all behind the enemy’s own lines, in his backcountry. The forest rebel is not under
            the
            spell of the optical illusion that automatically makes any aggressor an enemy of the nation. He is
            well-acquainted with its forced labor camps,
            with the hiding places of its oppressed, with its minority groups awaiting their fatal hour. He conducts his
            little
            war along the railway tracks and supply routes, he threatens bridges, communication lines, and depots. His
            presence
            wears on the enemy’s resources, forces them to multiply their posts. The forest rebel takes care of
            reconnaissance,
            sabotage, dissemination of information in the population. He disappears into impassable terrain, into
            anonymity,
            only to reappear the moment the enemy shows signs of weakness. He propagates constant unrest, provokes
            nightly
            panic. He can lay whole armies lame, as happened to the Napoleonic army in Spain.</p>

        <p>The forest rebel has no access to powerful means of combat, but he knows how a daring strike can destroy
            weapons
            that
            cost millions. He knows their tactical vulnerabilities, the cracks in their armor, where they are
            inflammable.
            He
            also has a greater liberty than troops to choose his arena, and he will make his moves where greater
            destruction
            can
            be effected with minor effort: at choke points; on vital arteries leading through difficult terrain; at
            locations
            distant from the bases. Every advance arrives at extreme points where men and means become precious due to
            the
            great
            length of the supply lines. Every front fighter is supported by another hundred in the rear—and this one
            comes
            up
            against the forest rebel. We are back to our ratio.</p>

        <p>The current international situation favors the forest passage; it creates counterbalances that invite free
            action.
            Every aggressor in the global civil war must reckon with his backcountry becoming troublesome—and each new
            territory
            that falls to him increases his backcountry. He is thus forced to intensify his control measures; this
            in turn leads to a flood of reprisals. His adversary places the highest importance on this erosion and all
            that
            may
            promote it. This means that the forest rebel will be able to rely on a global power, if not for direct
            support,
            then
            for weapons, logistics, and supplies. Not that he will ever be a party man.</p>

        <p>The forest passage conceals a new concept of defense, which can be put into practice with or without a
            standing
            army.
            In all countries— but especially in small ones—it will be recognized that preparing this form of defense is
            indispensable. Only superpowers can build up and administer grand arsenals. A forest passage, on the other
            hand,
            can
            be realized by a small minority, even by a single individual. This is the answer that freedom can
            provide—and
            freedom will have the last word.</p>

        <p>The forest passage has a closer relationship to freedom than any armaments can; a native will to resistance
            lives
            in
            it. Thus it is fit only for volunteers, who will defend themselves under all circumstances, whether a state
            trains,
            arms, and calls on them or not. In this manner they demonstrate—existentially—their freedom. The state
            cannot
            boast
            of an equivalent consciousness and so drops into a subordinate role, becomes a satellite.</p>

        <p>Freedom is today’s great theme; it is this force that will conquer fear. Freedom is the main subject of study
            for
            the
            free human being, and this includes the ways in which it can be effectively represented and manifested in
            resistance. We will not go into these details. Fear already diminishes when an individual is made aware in
            advance
            of his role in case of catastrophe. Catastrophes must be practiced for, as an emergency drill is practiced
            before
            embarking on a cruise. An entire population that prepares itself for a forest passage becomes a formidable
            force.
        </p>

        <p>One hears the objection that Germans were not made for this type of resistance. But there was much that they
            were
            not
            thought capable of. In regard to equipping with weapons and communications means, above all with
            transmitters,
            in
            regard to organizing maneuvers and exercises, to setting up bases and systems adapted to the new form of
            resistance—in
            short,
            in regard to the whole practical side of things, people will always emerge who will occupy themselves with
            these
            aspects and give them form. More important is to apply the old maxim that a free man be armed-—and not with
            arms
            under lock and key in an armory or barracks, but arms kept in his apartment, under his own bed. This will
            also
            have
            repercussions on what are considered fundamental rights.</p>

        <p>The gloomiest threat today is that of German armies going into battle against each other. Every increase in
            the
            arms
            buildup on either side heightens the danger. Regardless of, indeed across, these artificial borders, the
            forest
            passage is the only path on which common objectives can be followed. Passwords can also be found, exchanged,
            and
            circulated to prevent shooting on one another. Training on both sides, even ideological, cannot hurt—it may
            even
            be
            useful to know who will pass to the other side in the fateful moment, as in Leipzig.</p>

        <p>A power that focuses on the forest passage shows that it has no intention of an offensive attack.
            Nonetheless, it
            can
            greatly strengthen its defensive capacity, even deterringly so, and at low cost. This would enable
            long-sighted
            policies. For those who know their rights and can wait, the fruits fall into their laps on their own.</p>

        <p>We want to touch here on the possibility that the forest passage, as a path of mutual acknowledgement between
            necessity and freedom, could have repercussions on the army by allowing a return into history of the primal
            forms of
            resistance from which the military forms emerged. Whenever supreme danger reopens the naked issue of “to be
            or
            not
            to be,’ freedom is elevated from the merely legalistic sphere to a more sacred plane where fathers, sons,
            and
            brothers are reunited. The military model cannot hold its own here. The prospect of empty routine taking
            over is
            more dangerous than being unarmed. But this is not a question that concerns the forest passage as such; in
            the
            forest passage the individual determines the manner in which he will safeguard freedom. If he decides to
            serve,
            the
            army discipline will be transformed into freedom, will become merely one of its forms, one of its means. A
            free
            man
            gives
            the weapons their meaning.</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="30">30</section>

        <p>Like all the estate-based forms, so too the military is being recast with a specialized work character; that
            is,
            it too is being converted into a technical function. Of Hercules’ labors, it is essentially the first that
            has
            been left for the soldier: from time to time he has to clean out the Augean stable of politics. In this
            occupation it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep clean hands and to conduct war in a manner
            sufficiently
            distinguished from the handiwork of the police, on the one hand, and that of the butchers, and even the
            human
            flayers, on the other. But this is of less concern to the new commanders than spreading fear at any cost.
        </p>

        <p>In addition, new inventions are driving war into zones where limits no longer exist, and the new weapons have
            abolished all distinctions between combatants and noncombatants. The premise on which the estate
            consciousness
            of the soldier subsists disappears therewith, and the decline of chivalric forms follows hand in hand.</p>

        <p>A Bismarck could still decline to act on proposals to bring Napoleon III to trial. As the adversary he did
            not
            consider himself authorized for this role. Since then it has become customary to legally prosecute the
            defeated.
            The disputes associated with such verdicts are superfluous and without foundation—factions are in no
            position to
            judge, they thereby only perpetuate the violence. They also deprive the guilty of the tribunal they deserve.
        </p>

        <p>We live in times in which war and peace are difficult to distinguish from one another. Subtle shadings blur
            the
            borders between duty and crime. This can deceive even sharp eyes, because the disorientation of the times,
            the
            global guilt, spills over into the individual cases. The situation is aggravated by a lack of genuine
            sovereigns
            and by the fact that today’s powerful have all risen through the ranks of the factions. The capacity for
            acts
            directed at the whole-such initiatives as peace treaties, decrees, festivals, donations, and accretions—is
            thereby impaired from the start.</p>


        <p>Instead, the ruling powers intend to live off the whole. They are incapable of adding to or even
            maintaining it from their own inner surplus: through a gift of being. In this manner the triumphant factions
            squander the capital to satisfy the pleasures and purposes of the day, as Marwitz had already feared.</p>

        <p>The only consolation in this spectacle is its descending movement in a definite direction and with definite
            goals. Formerly such periods were called interregnums; today they present themselves as our industrial
            landscapes. They are distinguished by a lack of ultimate validity—and we have already come a long way if we
            can
            understand the necessity of this, and why it is in any event better than trying to maintain or reinstall
            already
            exhausted elements as valid options. Just as our sensibility objects to the use of gothic forms in the
            machine
            world, so it also reacts in the moral sphere.</p>

        <p>This has already been treated in detail in our study on the world of work. A person must know the rules of
            the
            territory in which they live. On the other hand, the evaluating consciousness remains incorruptible, and
            this
            fact is at the root of the pain, at the root of the perception of an unavoidable loss. The sight of a
            construction lot cannot impart the same quiet contentment that a masterpiece transmits to us, and just as
            little
            can the things one beholds there be perfect. Insofar as we know and accept this we are sincere, and such
            sincerity indicates an appreciation for higher orders of things. The sincerity necessarily creates a vacuum,
            which becomes apparent for instance in painting and also has its theological counterparts. The awareness of
            the
            loss is also expressed in the fact that all assessments of our situation that can be taken seriously relate
            either to the past or to the future. They lead to either cultural criticism or utopias, if we leave aside
            the
            cyclic theories. The falling away of legal and moral bonds is another of literature’s great themes; the
            American
            novel in particular moves in zones from which the last traces of moral obligation have disappeared. It has
            reached the naked bedrock, which elsewhere is still covered in decomposing layers of humus.</p>


        <p>In the forest passage we are forced to come to terms with crises in which neither law nor custom will
            remain standing. During these crises, similar patterns to those described at the outset for elections will
            become apparent. The masses will follow the propaganda, which shifts them into a purely technical
            relationship
            with law and morality. Not so the forest rebel. He has a tough decision to make: to reserve the right—at any
            cost—to judge for himself what he is called upon to support or contribute to. There will be considerable
            sacrifices, but they will be accompanied by an immediate gain in sovereignty. Naturally, as things stand,
            only a
            tiny minority will perceive the gain as such. Dominion, however, can only come from those who have preserved
            in
            themselves a knowledge of native human measures and who will not be forced by any superior power to forsake
            acting humanely. How they achieve this is a question of the resistance, which need not always be exercised
            openly. To demand as much is a typical idea of non-participants, but in practical terms it would amount to
            handing over a list of the last men to the tyrant.</p>

        <p>When all institutions have become equivocal or even disreputable, and when open prayers are heard even in
            churches not for the persecuted but for the persecutors, at this point moral responsibility passes into the
            hands of individuals, or, more accurately, into the hands of any still unbroken individuals.</p>

        <p>The forest rebel is the concrete individual, and he acts in the concrete world. He has no need of theories or
            of
            laws concocted by some party jurist to know what is right. He descends to the very springs of morality,
            where
            the waters are not yet divided and directed into institutional channels. Matters become simple here—
            assuming
            something uncorrupted still lives in him. We already saw that the great experience of the forest is the
            encounter with one’s own Self, with one’s invulnerable core, with the being that sustains and feeds the
            individual phenomenon in time. This meeting, which aids so powerfully in both returning to health and
            banishing
            fear, is also of highest importance in a moral sense. It conducts us to that</p>


        <p>strata which underlies all social life and has been common to all since the origins. It leads to the person
            who forms the foundation beneath the individual level, from whom the individuations emanate. At this depth
            there
            is not merely community; there is identity. It is this that the symbol of the embrace alludes to. The I
            recognizes itself in the other, following the age-old wisdom, “Thou art that.’ This other may be a lover, or
            it
            may be a brother, a fellow sufferer, or a defenseless neighbor. By helping in this manner, the I also
            benefits
            itself in the eternal. And with this the basic order of the universe is confirmed.</p>

        <p>These are facts of experience. Countless people alive today have passed the midpoint of the nihilistic
            process,
            the rock-bottom of the maelstrom. They have learned that the mechanism reveals its menacing nature all the
            more
            clearly there; man finds himself in the bowels of a great machine devised for his destruction. They have
            also
            learned firsthand that all rationalism leads to mechanism, and every mechanism to torture as its logical
            consequence. In the nineteenth century this had not yet been realized.</p>

        <p>Only a miracle can save us from such whirlpools. This miracle has happened, even countless times, when a man
            stepped out of the lifeless numbers to extend a helping hand to others. This has happened even in prisons,
            indeed especially there. Whatever the situation, whoever the other, the individual can become this fellow
            human
            being—and thereby reveal his native nobility. The origins of aristocracy lay in giving protection,
            protection
            from the threat of monsters and demons. This is the hallmark of nobility, and it still shines today in the
            guard
            who secretly slips a piece of bread to a prisoner. This cannot be lost, and on this the world subsists.
            These
            are the sacrifices on which it rests.</p>

        <p>As we see, predicaments arise that demand an immediate moral decision, and this is most true where the
            vortex is deepest and most turbulent.</p>

        <p>This has not been, and will not always be the case. Generally speaking, the institutions and the rules
            associated with them provide navigable terrain; what is legal and moral lies in the wind. Naturally, abuses
            occur, but there are also courts and police.</p>

        <p>This changes when morality is substituted by a subspecies of technology, that is, by propaganda, and the
            institutions are transformed into weapons of civil war. The decision then falls to the individual, as an
            either-or, since a third position, neutrality, is excluded. From this point forward, a particular form of
            infamy lies in non-participation, but also in making judgments from a non- participating position.</p>

        <p>The ruling powers, in their changing incarnations, also confront the individual with an either-or. This is
            the curtain of time, which rises perpetually on the same, ever-recurring spectacle. The figures appearing on
            the curtain are not the most important point—the either-or facing the individual has a quite different
            aspect. He is led to the point where a choice must be made between his directly bestowed human nature and
            the nature of a criminal.</p>

        <p>How will the individual stand up to this interrogation? Our future hangs in the balance on just this point.
            Perhaps it will be decided just where the darkness appears blackest. Alongside the autonomous moral
            decision, crime forms the other option for preserving sovereignty in the midst of the loss, in the midst of
            the nihilistic undermining of being. The French _ existentialists recognized this much correctly. Crime has
            nothing to do with nihilism; on the contrary, it offers a refuge from nihilism’s destructive erosion of
            self-awareness, a way out of the wastelands to</p>

        <p>which it leads. Chamfort already said: “Llhomme, dans |’état actuel de la société, me parait plus
            corrompu par sa raison que par ses passions."</p>

        <p>This probably also explains the cult of crime that is so characteristic of our times. Its dimensions and
            extent are easily underestimated. We get a good idea of its significance by regarding literature with this
            in mind, and not merely the lower genres, such as cinema and comic books, but also world literature. It
            would be no exaggeration to say that three quarters of it deals with criminals, with their deeds and their
            milieu, and that its appeal lies precisely there. This indicates how far the law has become dubious. People
            have a sense of being under foreign occupation, and in this relation the criminal appears a kindred soul.
            When the bandit Giuli-ano, a thief and multiple murderer, was hunted down in Sicily, a sense of condolence
            spread across the land. An experiment in living a free life in the wild had failed; this touched every soul
            in the gray masses and only strengthened their sense of entrapment. This process leads to a heroizing of
            wrongdoers. It also creates the ambiguous moral shadow that lies on all resistance movements, and not only
            on them.</p>

        <p>In our present age, each day can bring shocking new manifestations of oppression, slavery, or
            extermination—whether aimed at specific social groupings or spread over entire regions. Exercising
            resistance to this is legal, as an assertion of basic human rights, which, in the best cases, are guaranteed
            in constitutions but which the individual has nevertheless to enforce. Effective forms exist to this end,
            and those in danger must be prepared and trained to use them; this represents the main theme of a whole new
            education. Familiarizing those in danger with the idea that resistance is even possible is already
            enormously important—once that has been understood, even a tiny minority can bring down the mighty but
            clumsy colossus. This is another image that constantly returns in history and provides its mythical
            foundations; enduring buildings may then be erected on this base.</p>


        <p>It is the natural ambition of the power holder to cast a criminal light on legal resistance and even
            non-acceptance of its demands, and this aim gives rise to specialized branches in the use of force and the
            related propaganda. One tactic is to place the common criminal on a higher level than the man who resists
            their purposes.</p>

        <p>In opposing this, it is critical for the forest rebel to clearly differentiate himself from the criminal,
            not only in his morals, in how he does battle, and in his social relations, but also by keeping these
            differences alive and strong in his own heart. In a world where the existing legal and constitutional
            doctrines do not put the necessary tools in his hands, he can only find right within himself. We learn what
            needs to be defended much sooner from poets and philosophers.</p>

        <p>On another occasion we saw how neither the individual nor the masses are able to assert themselves in the
            elemental world into which we entered in 1914. However, this does not imply that man as a free and
            individual being will disappear. Rather, he must plumb the depths that lie beneath the surface of his
            individuality; there he will find means that have been submerged since the wars of religion. He will
            undoubtedly emerge from these titanic realms adorned with the jewels of a new freedom. But this can only be
            won by sacrifice, because freedom is precious and may demand that precisely one’s individuality, perhaps
            even one’s skin, be offered as a tribute to time. Each individual must know if freedom is more important to
            them— know whether they value how they are more than that they are.</p>

        <p>The real issue is that the great majority of people do not want freedom, are actually afraid of it. One must
            be free in order to become free, because freedom is existence-it is above all a conscious consent to
            existence, and the desire, perceived as a personal destiny, to manifest it. At this point man is free, and
            this world filled with oppression and oppressive agents, can only serve to make his freedom visible in all
            its splendor, just as a great mass of primary rock produces crystals through its high pressure.</p>



        <p>This new freedom is the old freedom, is absolute freedom cloaked in the new garments of the times. To
            lead it to victory, again and again, despite all the wiles of the zeitgeist: this is the meaning of the
            historical world.</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="32">32</section>

        <p>It has been noted that the basic sentiment of our epoch is hostile to property, and disposed to
            intervene in ways that harm not only the concerned parties but also the whole. Before our eyes, fields
            that sustained owners and tenants for thirty generations are carved up in a manner that leaves everyone
            hungry; forests that supplied wood for millennia are laid level; and from one day to the next the goose
            that laid the golden eggs is slaughtered and its flesh used to cook a broth that is shared with all but
            satisfies none. We had best reconcile ourselves to this spectacle, although large repercussions may be
            expected from it since it introduces intelligent but rootless new strata into society. In this respect
            some extraordinary prognoses made be ventured, particularly for England.</p>

        <p>On the one hand the attack is ethical, since the old formulation “Property is theft” has in the meantime
            become a universally recognized platitude. Everyone can have a good conscience regarding a property
            owner, while the owner himself has long since become uncomfortable in his own skin. Then there are the
            catastrophes, the wars, the tremendously increased revenues generated by technology. All this not only
            indicates a living off capital—it leaves no other choice. It is not for nothing that we build missiles
            that each cost more than a whole princedom once did.</p>

        <p>The phenomenon of the dispossessed, the proletariat, has imperceptibly taken on new characteristics. The
            world fills with new incarnations of suffering: the exiled, the ostracized, the violated, those robbed
            of their homeland and piece of earth, or brutally cast into the deepest abysses. These are our modern
            catacombs; and they are not opened by occasionally allowing the dispossessed to vote on how their misery
            is to be managed by the bureaucracy.</p>

        <p>Germany today is rich in the dispossessed and disenfranchised; in this sense it is the richest country
            on the planet. This is a wealth that may be utilized for better or for worse. Great momentum dwells in
            any movement supported by the dispossessed; but there is also the danger of it merely leading to a
            redistribution of injustice. This would be a never-ending spiral. Only those able to climb to a new
            moral floor in the edifice of the world can elude the spell of pure force.</p>

        <p>Alongside new denunciations, a new reading of the old “Property is theft” is in the making. Theories
            like these are more cutting on the part of the plundered than that of the plunderer, who exploits them
            to secure his spoils. Long since satiated, he devours his way into new spaces. However, other lessons
            may also be drawn from our epoch, and the events have certainly not passed without leaving traces. This
            is true above all for Germany, where the onslaught of images was particularly forceful. It brought
            profound changes with it. Such changes are only formulated into theories at a later stage; first they
            act on character. This also holds true for the verdict on property; it separates itself from the
            theories. As it became evident what property really is, the economic theories passed into second rank.</p>

        <p>The Germans were forced to reflect on all this. After their defeat, an attempt was made to impose a
            permanent dispossession and enslavement on them, a destruction through division. This was an even harder
            test than the war, but it was passed, silently, without weapons, without friends, without a voice in the
            world. In those days, months, and years, Germans participated in one of the greatest of experiences.
            They were thrown back entirely on their own property, on the layer within that lies beyond reach of
            destruction.</p>

        <p>There is a mystery here, and days like these unite a people even more than a critical victory on the
            battlefield. The wealth of the country resides in its men and women who have endured the kinds of
            extreme experiences that come around only once in many generations. This lends a certain modesty, but
            also security. Economic theories may hold “on the ship," but the latent, changeless property lies in the
            forest, like fertile soil that continually brings forth new harvests.</p>

        <p>Property in this sense is existential, attached to its holder and inseparably connected with his
            being. As the “hidden harmony is stronger than the visible one, " so too is this hidden property our
            authentic property. Goods and possessions become equivocal when they are not rooted in this level-this
            much has been made clear. The economic activities may seem directed against property; in reality, they
            establish who are real owners. This is also a question that is continually asked, and must be
            continually answered anew.</p>

        <p>Anyone who has lived through the burning of a capital or the invasion of an eastern army will never lose
            a lively mistrust of all that one can possess in life. This is an advantage, for it makes him someone
            who, if necessary, can leave his house, his farm, his library, without too much regret. He will even
            discover that this is associated with an act of liberation. Only the person who turns to look back
            suffers the fate of Lot’s wife.</p>

        <p>As there will always be natures who overestimate possessions, so there will never be a lack of people
            who see a cure-all in dispossession. Yet a redistribution of wealth does not increase wealth—rather it
            increases its consumption, as becomes apparent in any managed forest. The lion’s share clearly falls to
            the bureaucracy, particularly during those divisions where only the encumbrances are left over—of the
            shared fish only the bones remain.</p>

        <p>In this regard it is critical for the dispossessed individual to get beyond the idea of a personal theft
            perpetrated on him. Otherwise he remains with a trauma, a persisting inner sense of loss, which will
            later manifest in civil war. The estate has indeed been given away, and there is thus the risk that the
            disinherited will seek redress in other fields, of which terrorism is among the first to offer itself.
            Instead, it is better to convince oneself that one will be affected, necessarily and in all cases,
            albeit for diverse and changing reasons. Seen from the other pole the situation is that of an end sprint
            in which the runner expends his last reserves in sight of the finish line. In a very similar fashion,
            the drawing on capital reserves should not be understood as a pure expenditure but rather as investments
            in necessary new orders, above all in governance on a global scale. We might even say that the
            expenditures have been, and are such that they point either to ruin or some other extreme possibility.</p>

        <p>In any case, these insights cannot be expected of the man on the street. Yet they live in him—the way he
            comes to terms with destiny and pays the times their toll never ceases to move and astonish.</p>

        <p>When the dispossession encounters property as a pure idea, slavery is the inevitable result. The last
            visible property is the body and its working capacity. However, the fears that arise when the mind
            contemplates such eventualities are exaggerated. Our present terrors more than suffice. Nevertheless,
            the nightmarish utopias of Orwell and others have their usefulness—even if this particular author showed
            that he had no idea of the real, immutable power relations of this earth and simply surrendered himself
            to the terror. Such novels are like intellectual exercises by which a few detours and dead-ends may
            perhaps be avoided in practice.</p>

        <p>By considering the process not from “onboard” but rather from the perspective of the forest passage, we
            subject it to the court of the sovereign individual. It is up to him to decide what he considers
            property and how he will defend it. In an epoch like ours, he does best to present as few targets for
            attack as possible. Therefore, in taking stock of the situation, he must distinguish between things
            unworthy of sacrifice and those worth fighting for. These are our true, inalienable possessions. They
            are also that which, as Bias says, we carry with us through life, or, according to Heraclitus, which
            belong to our particular nature, like a man and his genius. The patria that we carry in our heart is one
            of these possessions, and it is from here, from the realm of the unextended, that we restitute its
            integrity when its boundaries are injured in the extended world.</p>

        <p>Preserving one’s true nature is arduous—and the more so when one is weighed down with goods. There is
            the danger that threatened Cortez’s Spaniards—they were dragged to the ground in that “mournful night”
            by the burden of gold that they were loath to part
            with. In comparison, the riches that belong to one’s being are not only incomparably more valuable,
            they are also the very source of all visible riches. Anyone grasping that will also understand that
            epochs which strive for the equality of all men will bear quite other fruits than those hoped for. They
            merely remove the fences and bars, the secondary divisions, and in this manner free up space. People are
            brothers, but they are not equal. The masses will always conceal individuals who by nature, that is, in
            their being, are rich, noble, kind, happy, or powerful. Abundance will flow their way to the same degree
            that the deserts grow. This leads to new powers and riches, to new distributions.</p>

        <p>To an impartial observer it may also become apparent that a latent, benevolent power is concealed in
            property, which benefits not only its owner. Man’s nature is not only that of creator, it is also that
            of destroyer, it is his daimonion. When the countless tiny limitations constraining this nature fall, it
            stands up like an unloosed Gulliver in the land of the Lilli-putians. The property consumed in this
            process is transformed into immediate functional power, and a new generation of overpowering titans
            arises. But this spectacle too has its limits, its moment in time. It founds no dynasties.</p>

        <p>This may explain why regimes are more solidly reestablished after periods in which the call for equality
            rang throughout the land. Both fear and hope lead the people in this direction. An ineradicable
            monarchic instinct clings to them, even when their only remaining contact with the figures of kings is
            at the waxworks. It is incredible how attentive and eager people are whenever a new claim to leadership
            is brought forward, from wherever or whomever it may come. Great hopes are always associated with any
            seizure of power, even from the side of the opposition. The subjects will not be disloyal; but they do
            have a fine sense of whether the powerful are remaining true to themselves and persevering in the role
            they have given themselves. Nevertheless, the people never lose hope in the arrival of a new Dietrich, a
            new Augustus—a new ruler, whose mission is announced by a new constellation in the heavens. They
            sense the veins of golden myth that run beneath the surface of history, directly below the surveyed
            ground of time.</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="33">33</section>

        <p>Can the being in man be destroyed? The views differ on this question, not only of confessions
            but also of religions—it is a question that only faith can answer. Whether this being is conceived
            as salvation, as the soul, or man’s eternal cosmic homeland-—it will always be evident that the
            attacks on it must originate from the darkest abyss. Even in today’s world, where the prevailing
            ideas barely grasp the surface of the process, it is sensed that offensives are underway with other
            objectives than mere dispossession or liquidation. The charge of “soul murder” is born from
            intuitions like these.</p>

        <p>An expression like this could only be coined by an already enfeebled spirit. Anyone with a concept
            of immortality and the orders based on immortality must find the expression objectionable. Where
            there is immortality, indeed, where only the belief in it is present, there points may be assumed
            where violence or any other earthly force cannot reach or damage man, let alone destroy him. The
            forest is a sanctuary.</p>

        <p>The panic so widely observable today is the expression of an emaci- ated spirit, of a passive
            nihilism that provokes its active counterpart. Of course, no one is easier to terrorize than the
            person who believes that everything is over when his fleeting phenomenon is extinguished. The new
            slaveholders have realized this, and this explains the importance for them of materialistic
            theories, which serve to shatter the old order during the insurrection and to perpetuate the reign
            of terror afterward. No bastion is to be left standing where a man may feel unassailable and
            therefore unafraid.</p>

        <p>To oppose this, it is essential to know that every man is immortal and that there is eternal life in
            him, an unexplored and yet inhabited land, which, though he himself may deny its existence, no
            timely power can ever take from him. For many, indeed for most, the access to this life will
            resemble a well into which rubble and rubbish has been thrown for centuries. Yet, if someone manages to
            clear it
            out, they will not only
            rediscover the spring but also the old images. Man is infinitely wealthier than he suspects. It is a
            wealth that no one can steal from him, and in the course of time it wells up, again and again, above all
            when pain has dredged out the depths.</p>

        <p>This is what man really wants to know. Here is the germ of his temporal anxiety, the cause of his
            thirst, which grows in the desert— this desert that is time. The more time dilates, the more conscious
            and compelling but also empty it becomes in its tiniest fractions, the more will burn the thirst for
            orders that transcend time.</p>

        <p>Man thus dying of thirst looks quite correctly to the theologian to alleviate his suffering, to
            alleviate it according to the original theological model of the staff striking water from the rock. If
            today we observe the spirit turning to philosophers for answers to this supreme question and contenting
            itself with increasingly discounted interpretations of the world, this is not a sign that the
            foundations have changed but rather that the intermediaries are no longer called behind the curtain. In
            such circumstances science is a better option, because some of the rubble blocking the approaches is
            also formed by the grand old words, which first became conventions, then annoyances, and in the end are
            simply boring.</p>

        <p>The words move with the ship; the home of the Word is the forest. The Word lies beneath the words like a
            gold base coat on an early painting. When the Word no longer animates the words, a horrible silence
            spreads under their deluge—at first in the temples, which are transformed into pretentious tombs, then
            in the forecourts.</p>

        <p>A very significant event here is philosophy’s turn from knowledge to language; it brings the spirit back
            into close contact with a primal phenomenon. This is more important than any physical discovery. The
            thinker enters a field in which an alliance is finally possible again with the theologian, and with the
            poet.</p>

        <section class="chapter" id="34">34</section>

        <p>That new access to the sources may be opened by envoys, by intermediaries—this is one of the
            great hopes. Whenever a genuine contact with being succeeds at even one point, this has powerful
            effects. History, indeed the possibility of dating time at all, depends on such instances. They
            represent investitures with primal creative power, which manifests itself in time.</p>

        <p>This also becomes apparent in language. Language belongs to man’s property, to his nature, his
            patrimony, and his patria, and it comes to him innocently, without him realizing its bounteousness
            and wealth. Language is more than a garden whose heirs will be refreshed by its flowers and fruits
            long into old age; it is also one of the great forms for all goods in general. As light makes the
            world and its forms visible, so language makes their inner nature comprehensible and is
            indispensable as a key to their treasures and secrets. Law and dominion begin in the visible and
            even in the invisible realms with the act of naming. The word is the material of the spirit and as
            such serves to build the boldest bridges; at the same time it is the Supreme instrument of power.
            All conquests in concrete and conceptual realms, all buildings and all roads, all conflicts and all
            treaties, are preceded by revelations, plans, and invocations, in word and in language—and the poem
            leads them all. Two kinds of history can be said to exist: one in the world of things; the other in
            the world of language. The second contains not only the higher insight but also the more effective
            power. Even the base must constantly regenerate itself from this force, also when it turns to
            violence. Yet the suffering passes and is transfigured into poetry.</p>

        <p>It is an old error to believe that we can judge when a poet may be awaited by the state of language.
            Language can be in full decay, and yet a poet will emerge from it like a lion out of the desert.
            Conversely, fruits do not always follow an exceptional bloom.</p>

        <p>Language does not live from its rules, for otherwise grammaticians would rule the world. On the
            primal ground, the word is no longer form, no longer a key. It becomes identical with being. It
            becomes creative energy. That is the source of its immense, unmintable power. And there no more than
            approaches take place. Language lives and moves around silence, as an oasis forms around a spring. A
            poem confirms that a man has managed to enter the timeless garden. Time then lives on this.</p>

        <p>Even when language has declined to a mere instrument for technicians and bureaucrats and tries to
            borrow from slang to simulate vitality, in its latent power it remains utterly unweakened. The
            dullness and the dust merely touch its surface. If we dig deeper, we reach a well-bearing seam in
            every desert of this earth. And with these waters new fertility rises to the surface.</p>

                <a href="#1">1 The questions put to us are simplified and made more incisive.</a>
                <a href="#2">2 They drive us to an either-or decision, as revealed in elections.</a>
                <a href="#3">3 The freedom to say no is systematically excluded.</a>
                <a href="#4">4 This is intended to demonstrate the superiority of the questioner, and</a>
                <a href="#5">5 it turns a nay into a venture that only one in a hundred will dare.</a>
                <a href="#6">6 The arena for this venture is strategically ill-chosen.</a>
                <a href="#7">7 This is no objection to its ethical significance.</a>
                <a href="#8">8 The forest passage is freedom’s new answer. </a>
                <a href="#9">9 Free men are powerful, even in tiny minorities.</a>
                <a href="#10">10 Our present epoch is poor in great men, but it brings figures to the light.</a>
                <a href="#11">11 The danger leads to the formation of small elites.</a>
                <a href="#12">12 The figures of the Worker and the Unknown Soldier are joined by a third, the Forest
                    Rebel.</a>
                <a href="#13">13 Fear</a>
                <a href="#14">14 can be conquered by the individual,</a>
                <a href="#15">15 once he realizes his power.</a>
                <a href="#16">16 The forest passage, as free action in the face of catastrophe,</a>
                <a href="#17">17 is independent of the foreground political technicalities and their groupings.</a>
                <a href="#18">18 It does not contradict the development,</a>
                <a href="#19">19 but brings freedom into it through the decisions of the individual.</a>
                <a href="#20">20 In the forest passage there is a meeting of man with himself in his undivided and
                    indestructible substance.</a>
                <a href="#21">21 This meeting banishes the fear of death.</a>
                <a href="#22">22 Even the churches can only lend a hand here,</a>
                <a href="#23">23 since man stands alone in his choices.</a>
                <a href="#24">24 The theologian may be able to make his situation clear to him</a>
                <a href="#25">25 but cannot deliver him from it.</a>
                <a href="#26">26 The forest rebel crosses the null-meridian under his own power.</a>
                <a href="#27">27 In the questions of healthcare, </a>
                <a href="#28">28 law,</a>
                <a href="#29">29 and arms, he takes his own sovereign decisions.</a>
                <a href="#30">30 Morally, too, he does not act according to any doctrine</a>
                <a href="#31">31 and reserves the right to judge the law for himself. He takes no part in the cult of
                    crime.</a>
                <a href="#32">32 He decides what to consider property and how he will defend at</a>
                <a href="#33">33 He is aware of the inviolable depths.</a>
                <a href="#34">34 from which the Word rises up to constantly fulfill the world.</a>
